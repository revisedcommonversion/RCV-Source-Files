== The Vision of Nahum

*Nahum | Ναούμ | נחום*

[#nah001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_The majesty of God in goodness to his people and severity against his enemies, 1-15._

1 [_The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite._]

2 God is jealous, and the LORD avenges. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD avenges and has indignation. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries [.linebr]#/# +
and he reserves wrath for his enemies.

3 The LORD is slow to anger and great in power, [.linebr]#/# +
and will not at all acquit the wicked. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, [.linebr]#/# +
and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

4 He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, [.linebr]#/# +
and dries up all the rivers. [.linebr]#/# +
Bashan and Carmel languish, [.linebr]#/# +
and the flower of Lebanon languishes.

5 The mountains quake at him [.linebr]#/# +
and the hills melt. [.linebr]#/# +
The earth is upheaved at his presence, [.linebr]#/# +
even the world and all who dwell therein.

6 Who can stand before his indignation? [.linebr]#/# +
And who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? [.linebr]#/# +
His fury is poured out like fire, [.linebr]#/# +
and the rocks are broken apart by him.

7 The LORD is good, [.linebr]#/# +
a stronghold in the day of trouble. [.linebr]#/# +
And he knows those who trust in him.

8 But with an over-running flood [.linebr]#/# +
he will make an utter end of the place thereof, [.linebr]#/# +
and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

9 What do you devise against the LORD? [.linebr]#/# +
He will make an utter end. [.linebr]#/# +
Affliction shall not rise up the second time.

10 For while they are tangled together as thorns [.linebr]#/# +
and while they are drunken as drunkards, [.linebr]#/# +
they shall be devoured as fully dried stubble.

11 There is one gone out of you [.linebr]#/# +
who devises evil against the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
He is a wicked counselor.

12 Thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"Though they are quiet and likewise many, [.linebr]#/# +
yet thus they shall be cut down, [.linebr]#/# +
and he shall pass away. [.linebr]#/# +
Though I have afflicted you, [.linebr]#/# +
I will no longer afflict you.

13 For now I will break his yoke from off you [.linebr]#/# +
and will tear off your bonds."

14 And the LORD has given a commandment concerning you, [.linebr]#/# +
that no more of your name be sown. [.linebr]#/# +
"Out of the house of your gods I will cut off [.linebr]#/# +
the engraved image and the molten image. [.linebr]#/# +
I will make your grave, for you are vile."

15 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him [.linebr]#/# +
who brings good tidings, who publishes peace! [.linebr]#/# +
O Judah, keep your solemn feasts [.linebr]#/# +
and perform your vows, [.linebr]#/# +
for the wicked shall no longer pass through you. [.linebr]#/# +
He is utterly cut off.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_The fearful and victorious armies of God against Nineveh, 1-13._

1 He who dashes in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
has come up before your face. [.linebr]#/# +
Guard the fortress, [.linebr]#/# +
watch the way, make your loins strong, [.linebr]#/# +
and fortify your power mightily.

2 For the LORD has turned away the excellence of Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
as the excellence of Israel. [.linebr]#/# +
For the emptiers have emptied them out [.linebr]#/# +
and marred their vine branches.

3 The shield of his mighty men is made red. [.linebr]#/# +
The valiant men are in scarlet. [.linebr]#/# +
The chariots shall be with flaming torches [.linebr]#/# +
in the day of his preparation, [.linebr]#/# +
and the fir-trees shall be terribly shaken.

4 The chariots shall rage in the streets. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall jostle one against another in the broad ways. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall seem like torches [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall run like the lightnings.

5 He shall recount his nobles. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall stumble in their walk. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall make haste to the wall thereof, [.linebr]#/# +
and the defense shall be prepared.

6 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, [.linebr]#/# +
and the palace shall be dissolved.

7 And she who stood firm shall be led away captive, [.linebr]#/# +
she shall be brought up, [.linebr]#/# +
and her women-servants shall lead her [.linebr]#/# +
as with the voice of doves, [.linebr]#/# +
beating upon their breasts.

8 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water. [.linebr]#/# +
Yet they shall flee away. [.linebr]#/# +
"Stand, stand," they shall cry, [.linebr]#/# +
but no one shall look back.

9 Take the plunder of silver and take the plunder of gold. [.linebr]#/# +
There is no end to the supply. [.linebr]#/# +
There is glory from all the desirable vessels.

10 She is empty, void, and waste. [.linebr]#/# +
And the heart melts, the knees smite together, [.linebr]#/# +
much pain is in all loins, [.linebr]#/# +
and all of their faces gather blackness.

11 Where is the dwelling of the lions [.linebr]#/# +
and the feeding-place of the young lions, [.linebr]#/# +
where the lion, the lioness, [.linebr]#/# +
and the lion's whelp walked [.linebr]#/# +
and no one made them afraid?

12 The lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps [.linebr]#/# +
and strangled for his lionesses. [.linebr]#/# +
And he filled his caves with prey [.linebr]#/# +
and his dens with flesh.

13 "Behold, I am against you," says the LORD of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +
"and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, [.linebr]#/# +
and the sword shall devour your young lions. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will cut off your prey from the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and the voice of your messengers [.linebr]#/# +
shall be heard no more."

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_The miserable ruin of Nineveh, 1-19._

1 Woe to the bloody city! [.linebr]#/# +
It is all full of lies and robberies. [.linebr]#/# +
The prey does not depart.

2 The noise of a whip [.linebr]#/# +
and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, [.linebr]#/# +
of the prancing horses, [.linebr]#/# +
and of the bounding chariots!

3 The horseman mounting, [.linebr]#/# +
the flashing sword, and the glittering spear! [.linebr]#/# +
There is a multitude of slain [.linebr]#/# +
and a great number of carcasses, [.linebr]#/# +
and there is no end of their corpses. [.linebr]#/# +
They stumble upon their corpses,

4 All because of the multitude of the lewd deeds [.linebr]#/# +
of the well-favored harlot, [.linebr]#/# +
the mistress of witchcrafts, [.linebr]#/# +
who sells nations through her lewd deeds [.linebr]#/# +
and families through her witchcrafts.

5 "Behold, I am against you," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +
"and I will lift your skirts over your face [.linebr]#/# +
and I will show the nations your nakedness [.linebr]#/# +
and the kingdoms your shame.

6 And I will cast abominable filth upon [.linebr]#/# +
you and make you vile [.linebr]#/# +
and will set you as a spectacle.

7 And it shall come to pass, [.linebr]#/# +
that all those who look upon you [.linebr]#/# +
shall flee from you [.linebr]#/# +
and say, 'Nineveh is laid waste! [.linebr]#/# +
Who will bemoan her?' [.linebr]#/# +
From where shall I seek comforters for you?"

8 Are you better than No-Amon [.linebr]#/# +
that was situated among the rivers, [.linebr]#/# +
that had the waters around it, [.linebr]#/# +
whose rampart was the sea [.linebr]#/# +
and her wall was from the sea?

9 Cush and Egypt were her strength, [.linebr]#/# +
and it was infinite. [.linebr]#/# +
Put and Lubim were your helpers.

10 Yet she was carried away. [.linebr]#/# +
She went into captivity. [.linebr]#/# +
Her young children also were dashed in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
at the head of all the streets. [.linebr]#/# +
And they cast lots for her honorable men, [.linebr]#/# +
and all her great men were bound in chains.

11 You also shall be drunken. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall be hid. [.linebr]#/# +
You also shall seek strength [.linebr]#/# +
because of the enemy.

12 All your strongholds shall be like fig-trees [.linebr]#/# +
with the first ripe figs. [.linebr]#/# +
If they are shaken, [.linebr]#/# +
they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.

13 Behold, your people in the midst of you are women. [.linebr]#/# +
The gates of your land [.linebr]#/# +
shall be set wide open to your enemies. [.linebr]#/# +
The fire shall devour your bars.

14 Draw waters for the siege. [.linebr]#/# +
Fortify your strongholds. [.linebr]#/# +
Go into clay and tread the mortar. [.linebr]#/# +
Make the brick-kiln strong.

15 The fire shall devour you there. [.linebr]#/# +
The sword shall cut you off. [.linebr]#/# +
It shall eat you up like the licking-locust. [.linebr]#/# +
Make yourself many as the licking-locust. [.linebr]#/# +
Make yourself many as the swarming-locust.

16 You have multiplied your merchants [.linebr]#/# +
above the stars of heaven. [.linebr]#/# +
The licking-locust strips and flies away.

17 Your crowned ones are as the swarming-locusts, [.linebr]#/# +
and your captains as the swarms of locusts, [.linebr]#/# +
which settle in the hedges on the cold day. [.linebr]#/# +
But when the sun arises they flee away, [.linebr]#/# +
and the place where they are is unknown.

18 Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria. [.linebr]#/# +
Your nobles shall dwell in the dust. [.linebr]#/# +
Your people are scattered upon the mountains [.linebr]#/# +
and no man gathers them.

19 There is no healing of your breach. [.linebr]#/# +
Your wound is grievous. [.linebr]#/# +
All who hear your fame [.linebr]#/# +
shall clap the hands over you. [.linebr]#/# +
For upon whom has your wickedness [.linebr]#/# +
not passed continually?
