== Paul's Letter to the Ephesians

*Ephesians | Προς Ἐφεσίοις*

[#eph001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_After the salutation, 1, 2, and thanksgiving for the Ephesians, 3, Paul discusses our election, 4, 5, and adoption by grace, 6-10; which is the true and proper fountain of man's salvation, 11, 12. And because the height of this mystery cannot easily be attained to, 13-15, he prays that they may come to the full knowledge and possession thereof in Christ, 16-23._

1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:

2 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, [[eph001-004]]4 According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love, [[eph001-005]]5 Having predestined us to the adoption of children to himself by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will, 6 To the praise of the glory of his grace in which he has made us accepted in the beloved, 7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, 8 In which he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 9 Having made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself, 10 So that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might collect in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him; 11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will, 12 So that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ; 13 In whom you also trusted after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also after you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.

15 Therefore, I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love toward all the saints, 16 Do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, 17 So that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him, 18 Having the eyes of your understanding being enlightened so that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, 20 Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, 21 Far above all principality, power, might, dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. 22 And he put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, 23 Which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_By comparing what we were by nature with what we are by grace, 1-9, Paul declares that we are made for good works and, being brought near by Christ, should not live as Gentiles and foreigners as in time past, but as citizens with the saints and the family of God, 10-22._

1 And he has revived you, who were dead in trespasses and sins, 2 In which in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience, 3 Among whom also we all had our manner of life in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. 4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us, 5 Even when we were dead in sins, has made us alive together with Christ (by grace you are saved), 6 And has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 So that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. 8 For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. 9 It is not by works, lest any man should boast. 10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.

11 Therefore, remember, that you, being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision (made in the flesh by hands), 12 At that time you were without Christ, being foreigners from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off are made near by the blood of Christ. 14 For he is our peace, who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us, 15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, to make in himself one new man of the two, so making peace, 16 And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having by it slain the enmity, [[eph002-017]]17 And came and preached "_peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near._" 18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. 19 Now therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of God, 20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone, 21 In whom all the building properly framed together grows to a holy temple in the Lord, 22 In whom you also are built together for a habitation of God through the Spirit.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_The hidden mystery that the Gentiles should be saved was made known to Paul by revelation, 1-7; and to him that grace was given so that he should preach it, 8-12. He desires that they not faint for his tribulation, 13; and prays that they may perceive the great love of Christ toward them, 14-21._

1 For this cause, I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, 2 If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me on your account, 3 That by revelation he made the mystery known to me, as I wrote before in few words, 4 By which when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, 5 Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, 6 That the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of his promise in Christ by the Gospel, 7 Of which I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power. 8 To me, who am less than the least of all saints, this grace was given so that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ, 10 To the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in heavenly places, 11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. 12 In him we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 13 Therefore, I desire that you do not faint at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.

14 For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 16 That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man, 17 So that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, and that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, length, depth, and height, 19 And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

20 Now to him who is able to do the more abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, 21 To him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul exhorts to unity, 1-6; and declares that God therefore gives various gifts to men, 7-10; so that his church might be edified, 11-15, and grow up in Christ, 16, 17. He calls them from the impurity of the Gentiles, 18-23; to put on the new man, 24; to cast off lying, 25-28; and corrupt communication, 29-32._

1 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you that you walk worthy of the vocation by which you are called, 2 With all lowliness and meekness, with patience, forbearing one another in love, 3 Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4 There is one body and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling, 5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, through all, and in you all.

7 But to each of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. [[eph004-008]]8 Therefore, he says,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|
|"_When he ascended on high,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_he led captivity captive,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and gave gifts to men._"
|===

9 Now that "he ascended," what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? 10 He who descended is the same also who ascended far above all heavens so that he might fill all things. 11 And he gave some, apostles; some, prophets; some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers, 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, 13 Until we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, 14 That we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried around by every wind of doctrine and by the trickery of men and cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive, 15 But, speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, who is the head, even Christ, 16 From whom the whole body properly joined together and united by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.

17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on do not walk as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 18 Having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart, 19 Who, being callous, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness. 20 But you have not learned Christ in this way, 21 If indeed you have heard him and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus. 22 Concerning the former manner of life, [you were taught] to put off the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, 23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 24 And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

[[eph004-025]]25 Therefore, putting away lying, "_each of you speak truth with his neighbor,_" for we are members of one another. [[eph004-026]]26 "_Be angry, and do not sin._" Do not let the sun go down upon your wrath, 27 Neither give place to the devil. 28 Let him who stole no longer steal, but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, so that he may have [something] to give to him who needs. 29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying so that it may minister grace to the hearers. 30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 31 Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil-speaking be put away from you, along with all malice. 32 And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_After general exhortations to love, 1, 2; to flee fornication, 3; and all uncleanness, 4-6; not to converse with the wicked, 7-14; to walk carefully, 15-17; and to be filled with the Spirit, 18-21; Paul descends to the particular duties, how wives ought to obey their husbands, 22-24; and husbands ought to love their wives, 25-31, even as Christ does his church, 32, 33._

1 Be therefore followers of God, as dear children, 2 And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and has given himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.

3 But lewdness and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as is proper for saints, 4 Neither filthiness, foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate, but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this you know, that no lewd person, unclean person, or covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

6 Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience. 7 Therefore, do not be partakers with them. 8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light 9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth), 10 Proving what is acceptable to the Lord. 11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. 12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret. 13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light, for whatever is made manifest is light. 14 Therefore, he says,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|"Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, [.linebr]#/# +
and Christ will give you light."
|===

15 See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 17 Therefore, do not be unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. 18 And do not be drunk with wine, in which is excess, but be filled with the Spirit, 19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, 20 Giving thanks always for all things to God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 21 Submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.

22 Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, and he is the Savior of the body. 24 Therefore, as the church is subject to Christ, so let wives be to their own husbands in everything.

25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it 26 So that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 27 And that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. 28 Likewise, men also ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife, loves himself. 29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the church. 30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. [[eph005-031]]31 "_For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two of them shall be one flesh._" 32 This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 33 Nevertheless, let each of you in particular thus love his wife even as himself, and the wife see that she reverences her husband.

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_The duty of children toward their parents, 1-4; of servants toward their masters, 5-9. Our life is a warfare, not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual enemies, 10-12. The complete armor of a Christian, 13-17; and how it ought to be used, 18-20. Tychicus is commended, 21-24._

1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. [[eph006-002]]2 "_Honor your father and mother_"—which is the first commandment with promise— [[eph006-003]]3 "_So that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth._"

4 And fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the instruction and admonition of the Lord.

5 Servants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ, 6 Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, 7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord and not to men, 8 Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, the same he will receive from the Lord, whether he is bond or free.

9 And masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening, knowing that your Master also is in heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him.

10 Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. 11 Put on the whole armor of God so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 13 Therefore, take up the whole armor of God so that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. [[eph006-014]]14 Stand therefore, having your "_loins girded in truth,_" and having on the "_breast-plate of righteousness,_" 15 And having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked. [[eph006-017]]17 And take the "_helmet of salvation,_" and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, 18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching for this purpose with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. 19 And pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me so that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel, 20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds, so that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

21 But so that you also may know my affairs and how I am doing, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things, 22 Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, so that you may know our affairs and that he may comfort your hearts.

23 Peace be to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 24 May grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
