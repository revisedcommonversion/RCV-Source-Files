=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_Jehoiakim's captivity, 1, 2. Ashpenaz takes Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 3-7. Refusing the king's portion, they prosper with pulse and water, 8-16. Their proficiency in wisdom, 17-21._

1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god. And he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.

3 And the king told Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that he should bring some of the children of Israel, even some of the royal family and of the princes, 4 Children in whom there was no blemish, but of good appearance, skillful in all wisdom, intelligent in knowledge, understanding science, and those who had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the writing and the language of the Chaldeans. 5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food and of the wine which he drank, thus nourishing them three years, so that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. 6 Now among these were some of the children of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah— 7 To whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names. For he gave to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, Shadrach; and to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-nego.

8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore, he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 9 Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. 10 And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, "I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your provision and your drink. For why should he see your faces more meager than the children who are of your sort? Then you will make me endanger my head to the king." 11 Then Daniel said to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 12 "Prove your servants, I implore you, ten days. And let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink. 13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before you, and the countenances of the children who eat of the portion of the king's provision. And as you see, deal with your servants."

14 So he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days. 15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children who ate the portion of the king's provision. 16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their food and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.

17 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.

18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 19 And the king spoke with them. And among them all there was found no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore, they stood before the king. 20 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding wherein the king questioned them, he found them ten times superior to all the magicians and astrologers who were in all his realm. 21 And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_Nebuchadnezzar, forgetting his dream, requires the Chaldeans make it known, by promises and threatenings, 1-9. They, acknowledging their inability, are judged to die, 10-13. Daniel, obtaining some respite, reveals the dream, 14-18. He blesses God, 19-23. He, staying the decree, is brought to the king, 24-30. The dream, 31-35. The interpretation, 36-45. Daniel's advancement, 46-49._

1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him. 2 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to declare to the king his dream. So they came and stood before the king. 3 And the king said to them, "I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream."

4 Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Syriac, "O king, live forever. Tell your servants the dream and we will reveal the interpretation." 5 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, "The thing has gone from me. If you will not make known to me the dream, with its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill. 6 But if you make known the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore, tell me the dream and its interpretation." 7 They answered again and said, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will reveal its interpretation." 8 The king answered and said, "I know of certainty that you would gain the time, because you see the thing has gone from me. 9 But if you will not make known to me the dream, there is but one decree for you, for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the time is changed. Therefore, tell me the dream and I shall know that you can tell me its interpretation." 10 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, "There is not a man upon the earth who can disclose the king's matter, for there is no king, lord, nor ruler who has asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean. 11 And it is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can reveal it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."

12 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 13 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain. And they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

14 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon. 15 He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, "Why is the decree so hasty from the king?" Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. 16 Then Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time so that he might reveal to the king the interpretation.

17 Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, 18 That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

19 Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 20 Daniel answered and said,

24 Therefore, Daniel went into Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king and I will declare to the king the interpretation."

25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him: "I have found a man of the captives of Judah who will make known to the king the interpretation." 26 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?" 27 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, "The secret which the king has demanded, the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot reveal to the king. 28 But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets and makes known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head upon your bed, are these. 29 As for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind upon your bed about what should come to pass hereafter, and he who reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass. 30 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living man, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.

31 "You, O king, saw, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before you, and its form was awesome. 32 The head of this image was of fine gold, his chest and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, 33 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. 34 You were looking until a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and broke them to pieces. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold were broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors, and the wind carried them away so that no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.

36 "This is the dream, and we will tell its interpretation before the king. 37 You, O king, are a king of kings, for the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory. 38 And wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field, or the birds of the heaven, he has given into your hand and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.

39 "And after you another kingdom inferior to you shall arise, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.

40 "And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things. And as iron that breaks all these, it shall break in pieces and bruise. 41 And whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potter's clay and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided, but there shall be in it some of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with the miry clay. 42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken. 43 And whereas you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the descendants of men, but they shall not cleave to one another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.

44 "And in the days of these kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. 45 Because you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain, and its interpretation sure."

46 Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him. 47 The king answered to Daniel, and said, "Of a truth it is that your God is a God of gods, a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you could reveal this secret." 48 Then the king made Daniel a great man, gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. 49 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Nebuchadnezzar dedicates a golden image in Dura, 1-7. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are accused of not worshiping the image, 8-12. They, being threatened, make a good confession, 13-18. They are cast into the furnace, 19-23, from which God delivers them, 24-27. Nebuchadnezzar, seeing the miracle, blesses God and advances them, 28-30._

1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to convene the princes, the governors, the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 3 Then the princes, the governors, the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up, and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 4 Then a herald cried aloud, "To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, 5 That at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up. 6 And whoever shall not fall down and worship shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace." 7 Therefore, at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

8 Therefore, at that time some Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews. 9 They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever. 10 You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image. 11 And whoever shall not fall down and worship, he shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 12 There are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. These men, O king, have not regarded you. They do not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up."

13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king. 14 Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, "Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do you not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? 15 Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, very well. But if you do not worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that God who shall deliver you out of my hands?"

16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 17 If it is so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. 18 But if not, may it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up."

19 Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Therefore, he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was accustomed to be heated. 20 And he commanded the most mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. 21 Then these men were bound in their coats, their pants, their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 22 Therefore, because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. 23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, rose up in haste, and spoke, and said to his counselors, "Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?" They answered and said to the king, "True, O king." 25 He answered and said, "Behold, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt. And the form of the fourth is like the son of God." 26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spoke, and said, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, servants of the most high God, come forth, and come here." Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth from the midst of the fire. 27 And the princes, governors, captains, and the king's counselors assembled and saw that the fire had no power over the bodies of these men. The hair of their head was not singed, neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire passed upon them.

28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. And they have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies so that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God. 29 Therefore, I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language which speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who can deliver after this sort." 30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.

_Nebuchadnezzar confesses God's kingdom, 1-3, makes relation of his dreams, which the magicians could not interpret, 4-7. Daniel hears the dream, 8-18. He interprets it, 19-27. The dream fulfilled, 28-37._

1 Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages who dwell in all the earth: "May peace be multiplied to you. 2 I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God has wrought toward me.

4 "I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house and flourishing in my palace. 5 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 6 Therefore, I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me so that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. 7 Then the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in, and I told the dream before them, but they did not make known to me its interpretation. 8 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods, and before him I told the dream, saying, 9 'O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen and its interpretation. 10 Thus were the visions of my head in my bed:

13 'I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven. 14 He cried aloud, and said thus:

18 'This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation. But you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.'

19 "Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, 'Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you.' Belteshazzar answered, and said, 'My lord, may the dream be to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies. 20 The tree that you saw, which grew and was strong, whose height reached to the heaven and its sight to all the earth, 21 Whose leaves were fair, its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of heaven had their habitation— 22 It is you, O king, who have grown and become strong, for your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth. 23 And the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, "Hew the tree down and destroy it, yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts of the field, until seven times shall pass over him." 24 This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which has come upon my lord the king: 25 They shall drive you from men and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. They shall cause you to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet you with the dew of heaven. And seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever he wishes. 26 And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots, your kingdom shall be sure to you, after you know that the heavens rule. 27 Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening of your tranquility.'

28 "All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. 29 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. 30 The king spoke, and said, 'Is this not great Babylon, which I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty?' 31 While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, 'O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken, "The kingdom has departed from you. 32 And they shall drive you from men and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. They shall cause you to eat grass as oxen. And seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever he wishes."' 33 The same hour, the thing was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from men and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers and his nails like birds' claws.

34 "And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven and my understanding returned to me. And I blessed the most High and I praised and honored him who lives forever,

36 "At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me. I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me. 37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are truth and his ways are judgment. And he is able to abase those who walk in pride."

[.outline.text-center]
_Belshazzar's impious feast, 1-4. A hand-writing unknown to the magicians, troubles the king, 5-9. At the commendation of the queen, Daniel is brought, 10-16. He, reproving the king of pride and idolatry, 17-24, reads and interprets the writing, 25-29. The monarchy is transferred to the Medes, 30, 31._

1 Belshazzar the king made a great feast to one thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. 2 Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem, so that the king, his princes, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them. 3 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem, and the king, his princes, his wives, and his concubines drank from them. 4 They drank wine and praised the gods of gold, of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

5 In the same hour fingers of a man's hand came forth and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace. And the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. 6 Then the king's countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him, and the joints of his loins were loosened and his knees smote one against another. 7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, "Whoever reads this writing and declares to me its interpretation shall be clothed with scarlet, have a chain of gold around his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom." 8 Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king its interpretation. 9 Then the king Belshazzar was greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonished.

10 Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house. And the queen spoke, and said, "O king, live forever. Do not let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your countenance be changed. 11 There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. And in the days of your father, light, understanding, and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him, whom the king Nebuchadnezzar your father—your father the king—made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers, 12 Because an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, the interpreting of dreams, the declaring of riddles, and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will reveal the interpretation."

13 Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king spoke and said to Daniel, "Are you that Daniel who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judea? 14 I have even heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light, understanding, and excellent wisdom is found in you. 15 And now the wise men and the astrologers have been brought in before me so that they should read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not reveal the interpretation of the thing. 16 And I have heard of you, that you can make interpretations and dissolve doubts. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold around your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."

17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, "Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another; however, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation. 18 O king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom, majesty, glory, and honor. 19 And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he wished he slew, whom he wished he kept alive, whom he wished he set up, and whom he wished he put down. 20 But when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him. 21 And he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. They fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the most high God rules in the kingdom of men and that he appoints over it whomever he will. 22 And you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this, 23 But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven. And they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you, your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drank wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver, gold, brass, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see, nor hear, nor know. And the God in whose hand is your breath and all your ways, you have not glorified. 24 Then the part of the hand was sent from him and this writing was written.

25 "And this is the writing that was written: 'MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.' 26 This is the interpretation of the thing: 'MENE': God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it; 27 'TEKEL': you are weighed in the balances, and are found lacking; 28 'PERES': your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians."

29 Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, put a chain of gold around his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.

30 In that night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was slain. 31 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.

_Daniel is made chief of the presidents, 1-3. They, conspiring against him, obtain an idolatrous decree, 4-9. Daniel, accused of the breach thereof, is cast into the lions' den, 10-17. Daniel is saved, 18-23; his adversaries devoured, 24; and God magnified by a decree, 25-28._

1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty princes who should be over the whole kingdom, 2 And over these three presidents, of whom Daniel was first, so that the princes might give accounts to them, and the king should have no loss. 3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him, and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. 4 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom, but they could find no occasion nor fault, because he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him. 5 Then these men said, "We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God."

6 Then these presidents and princes went together to the king, and said thus to him: "King Darius, live forever. 7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, the princes, the counselors, and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree, that whoever asks a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. 8 Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter." 9 Therefore, king Darius signed the writing and the decree.

10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house, and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, prayed, and gave thanks before his God as he did before. 11 Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. 12 Then they came near and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree, "Have you not signed a decree, that every man who asks a petition of any god or man within thirty days, except of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?" The king answered and said, "The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter." 13 Then they answered and said before the king, "That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, does not regard you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day."

14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was much displeased with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him. And he labored until the setting of the sun to deliver him. 15 Then these men went together to the king, and said to the king, "Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed."

16 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, "Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you." 17 And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, so that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. 18 Then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting, neither were instruments of music brought before him. And his sleep went from him.

19 Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions. 20 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel, and the king spoke and said to Daniel, "O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?" 21 Then Daniel said to the king, "O king, live forever. 22 My God has sent his angel and has shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me, because before him innocence was found in me. And also before you, O king, I have done no hurt." 23 Then the king was exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God. 24 And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions—them, their children, and their wives—and the lions had the mastery of them and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den.

25 Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages who dwell in all the earth: "May peace be multiplied to you. 26 I make a decree, that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel,

_Daniel's vision of the four beasts, 1-8, and of God's kingdom, 9-14. The interpretation thereof, 15-28._

1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed. Then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters. 2 Daniel spoke and said, "I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea. 3 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse from one another. 4 The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. I beheld until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. 5 And behold another beast, a second, like a bear, and it raised itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth, and they said thus to it: 'Arise, devour much flesh.' 6 After this I beheld, and behold another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it. 7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceedingly strong, and it had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces and stamped the remainder with its feet. And it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. 8 I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before which there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things.

15 "I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. 16 I came near to one of those who stood by and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things: 17 'These great beasts, which are four, are four kings which shall arise out of the earth. 18 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.'

19 "Then I wished to know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass, which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the remainder with his feet, 20 And of the ten horns that were on his head, and of the other which came up and before which three fell, even of the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. 21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them, 22 Until the Ancient of days came and judgment was given to the saints of the most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.

23 "Thus he said: 'The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth, tread it down, and break it in pieces. 24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings who shall arise. And another shall rise after them, and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings. 25 And he shall speak great words against the most High and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws. And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. 26 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it to the end. 27 And the kingdom, the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.'

28 "Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my cogitations greatly troubled me and my countenance changed in me, but I kept the matter in my heart."

_Daniel's vision of the ram and goat, 1-12. The two thousand three hundred days of the suspension of the daily sacrifice, 13, 14. Gabriel comforts Daniel, and interprets the vision, 15-27._

1 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. 2 And I saw in a vision, and it came to pass when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in a vision that I was by the Ulai River. 3 Then I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns. And the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 4 I saw the ram goring westward, northward, and southward, so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any who could deliver out of his hand, but he did according to his will and became great.

5 And as I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and did not touch the ground. And the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. 6 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran to him in the fury of his power. 7 And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him and smote the ram and broke his two horns. And there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and stamped upon him. And there was no one who could deliver the ram out of his hand. 8 Therefore, the male goat became very great, and when he was strong, the great horn was broken and in its stead four notable ones came up toward the four winds of heaven.

9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. 10 And it grew great, even to the host of heaven, and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground and stamped upon them. 11 It even magnified itself to the prince of the host, and by it the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. 12 And a host was given to it against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground and did its pleasure and prospered. 13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint who spoke, "How long shall the vision be concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?" 14 And he said to me, "Until two thousand and three hundred days. Then the sanctuary shall be cleansed."

15 And it came to pass, when I, even I, Daniel, had seen the vision and sought the meaning, then behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. 16 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, "Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision." 17 So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was afraid and fell upon my face, but he said to me, "Understand, O son of man, the vision shall be for the time of the end."

18 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground, but he touched me and set me upright. 19 And he said, "Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the last end of the indignation, for at the time appointed the end shall be.

20 "The ram which you saw having two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia.

21 "And the rough goat is the king of Grecia. And the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. 22 Now that which is broken, where four stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.

_Daniel, considering the time of the captivity, 1, 2, makes confession of sins, 3-15, and prays for the restoration of Jerusalem, 16-19. Gabriel informs him of the seventy weeks, 20-27._

1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the offspring of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans, 2 In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood by books the number of the years, concerning which the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. 3 And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. 4 And I prayed to the LORD my God and made my confession, and said, "O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to those who love him and to those who keep his commandments, 5 We have sinned, have committed iniquity, have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from your precepts and from your judgments, 6 Neither have we listened to your servants the prophets who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, our fathers, and to all the people of the land.

7 "O Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but to us, disgrace, as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near and who are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you. 8 O Lord, to us belongs disgrace, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you. 9 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him, 10 Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets. 11 And all Israel has transgressed your law, even by departing, and they have not obeyed your voice; therefore, the curse is poured upon us, along with the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him. 12 And he has confirmed his words which he spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil. For under the whole heaven it has not been done as it has been done upon Jerusalem. 13 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us, yet we have not made our prayer before the LORD our God, so that we might turn from our iniquities and understand your truth. 14 Therefore, the LORD has watched over the evil and brought it upon us, for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he does, but we have not obeyed his voice.

15 "And now, O Lord our God, who have brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have obtained yourself renown, as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly. 16 O Lord, according to all your righteousness, I implore you, let your anger and your fury be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. Because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all who are around us. 17 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer and supplications of your servant and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. 18 O my God, incline your ear and hear. Open your eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by your name. For we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousnesses, but for your great mercies. 19 O Lord, hear. O Lord, forgive. O Lord, listen and do. Do not defer, O my God, for your own sake. For your city and your people are called by your name."

20 And while I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God, 21 Even while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. 22 And he informed me and talked with me, and said, "O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill and understanding. 23 At the beginning of your supplications the commandment came forth, and I have come to show you, for you are greatly beloved. Therefore, understand the matter and consider the vision.

24 "Seventy weeks are determined upon your people and upon your holy city to finish the transgression, to make an end of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the holy of holies. 25 Know therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah, the Prince, shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. It shall be built again with a plaza and a moat, even in troubled times. 26 And after sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for himself. And the people of the prince who come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end shall be with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined. 27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week. And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease. And on the wing of abominations, he shall come to make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that which is determined shall be poured upon the desolate."

_Daniel, having humbled himself, sees a vision, 1-9. Being troubled with fear, he is comforted by the angel, 10-21._

1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar, and the thing was true, but the appointed time was long. And he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.

2 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks. 3 I ate no pleasant bread, neither flesh nor wine entered my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled. 4 And on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is the Hiddekel, 5 I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz. 6 His body was also like beryl, his face as the appearance of lightning, his eyes as lamps of fire, his arms and his feet like the appearance of polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. 7 And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision. The men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves. 8 Therefore, I was left alone and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me, for my vigor was changed into corruption and I retained no strength. 9 Yet I heard the voice of his words. And when I heard the voice of his words, I was in a deep sleep on my face with my face toward the ground.

10 And behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. 11 And he said to me, "O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I am now sent to you." And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling. 12 Then he said to me, "Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to chasten yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come because of your words. 13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days. But behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there with the kings of Persia. 14 Now I have come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to those days."

15 And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face toward the ground and I became mute. 16 And behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke, and said to him who stood before me, "O my lord, by the vision my sorrows have turned upon me and I have retained no strength. 17 For how can this servant of my lord talk with my lord? For as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me."

18 Then the one like the appearance of a man came back and touched me and strengthened me, 19 And said, "O man greatly beloved, do not fear. Peace be with you. Be strong. Indeed, be strong." And when he had spoken to me, I was strengthened, and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me." 20 Then he said, "Do you know for what cause I come to you? And now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. And when I have gone forth, behold, the prince of Grecia shall come. 21 But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth. And there is no one who strengthens himself with me against these, except Michael your prince."

_The overthrow of Persia by the king of Grecia, 1-4. Leagues and conflicts between the kings of the south and of the north, 5-29. The invasion and tyranny of the Romans, 30-45._

1 "Also I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him. 2 And now I will show you the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia. And a fourth shall be far richer than all of them, and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia. 3 And a mighty king shall stand up, who shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will. 4 And when he stands up, his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled, for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.

5 "And the king of the south shall be strong, but one of his princes, he shall be strong above him and have dominion. His dominion shall be a great dominion. 6 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together, for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement. But she shall not retain the power of the arm, neither shall he nor his arm stand, but she shall be given up, along with those who brought her, he who begot her, and he who strengthened her in these times. 7 But out of a branch of her roots one shall stand up in his estate, who shall come with an army, enter into the fortress of the king of the north, deal against them, and prevail. 8 And he shall also carry captive into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold, and he shall continue more years than the king of the north. 9 And the king of the south shall come into his kingdom and shall return into his own land.

10 "But his sons shall be stirred up and shall assemble a multitude of great forces. And one shall certainly come, overflow, and pass through. Then he shall return and be stirred up, even to his fortress. 11 And the king of the south shall be moved with wrath and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north. And he shall set forth a great multitude, but the multitude shall be given into his hand. 12 And when he has taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down many ten thousands, but he shall not be strengthened by it. 13 For the king of the north shall return and set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after some years with a great army and with much riches.

14 "And in those times many shall stand up against the king of the south. The robbers of your people shall also exalt themselves to establish the vision, but they shall fall. 15 And the king of the north shall come, cast up a siege-mound, and take the most fortified cities. And the arms of the south shall not withstand, nor his chosen people, nor shall there be any strength to withstand. 16 But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and no one shall stand before him. And he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed. 17 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him. He shall do so. And he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her, but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him. 18 After this he shall turn his face to the coastlands and shall take many, but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease, and without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him. 19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land, but he shall stumble and fall and not be found.

20 "Then a raiser of taxes shall stand up in his estate in the glory of the kingdom, but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle. 21 And in his estate a vile person shall stand up, to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom, but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. 22 And with the arms of a flood they shall be overflowed from before him and shall be broken, as well as the prince of the covenant. 23 And after the league is made with him he shall work deceitfully, for he shall come up and shall become strong with a small people. 24 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province, and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers. He shall scatter among them the plunder, loot, and riches, and he shall devise his plans against the strongholds, even for a time. 25 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army. And the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army, but he shall not stand, for they shall devise plans against him. 26 And those who feed from the portion of his provisions shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow. And many shall fall down slain. 27 And both these kings' hearts shall be set to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table, but it shall not prosper, for yet the end shall be at the time appointed. 28 Then he shall return into his land with great riches, and his heart shall be against the holy covenant. And he shall take action and return to his own land.

29 "At the time appointed he shall return and come toward the south, but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter. 30 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him; therefore, he shall be grieved, return, and have indignation against the holy covenant. He shall do so. And he shall even return and have regard for those who forsake the holy covenant. 31 And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate. 32 And those who do wickedly against the covenant he shall corrupt by flatteries, but the people who know their God shall be strong and take action. 33 And those who understand among the people shall instruct many, yet they shall fall by the sword, by flame, by captivity, and by plunder for many days. 34 Now when they fall, they shall be assisted with a little help, but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. 35 And some of them of understanding shall fall, in order to try them, to purge them, and to make them white, even to the time of the end, because it is yet for a time appointed.

36 "And the king shall do according to his will. He shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods. He shall prosper until the indignation is accomplished, for that which is determined shall be done. 37 He shall not regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god, for he shall magnify himself above all. 38 But in his estate he shall honor the God of forces. And a god whom his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold, silver, precious stones, and pleasant things. 39 He shall do so in the strongest fortresses with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory. And he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.

40 "And at the time of the end the king of the south shall war against him. And the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, with horsemen, and with many ships, and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over. 41 He shall also enter into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown, but these shall escape out of his hand: Edom, Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. 42 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape. 43 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of Egypt. The Libyans and the Cushites shall be at his steps. 44 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; therefore, he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and to utterly sweep many away. 45 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain. Yet he shall come to his end, and no one shall help him."

_Michael shall deliver Israel from their troubles, 1-4. Daniel is informed of the times, 5-13._

1 "And at that time Michael shall stand up, the great prince who stands for the children of your people. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone who is found written in the book. 2 And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. [[dan012-003]]3 And those who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever. 4 But you, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."

5 Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, there stood another two: one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. 6 And someone said to the man clothed in linen, who was upon the waters of the river, "How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?" 7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever, that it shall be for a time, times, and a half of a time. And when he has made an end of dispersing the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. 8 And I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, "O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?" 9 And he said, "Go your way Daniel. For the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end. 10 Many shall be purified, made white, and tried, but the wicked shall do wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand. [[dan012-011]]11 And from the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away and the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days. 12 Blessed is he who waits, and comes to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days. 13 But go your way until the end. For you shall rest and stand in your lot at the end of the days."
