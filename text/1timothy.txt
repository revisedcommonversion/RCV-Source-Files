== Paul's First Letter to Timothy

*1st Timothy | Προς Τιμόθεον Α'*

[#fti001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_Timothy is put in mind of the charge which was given to him by Paul at his going to Macedonia, 1-4. Of the right use and end of the law, 5-10. Of Paul's calling to be an apostle, 11-19; and Hymeneus and Alexander, 20._

1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ, who is our hope,

2 To Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

3 As I implored you when I went into Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine, 4 Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith. 5 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, 6 From which some, having swerved, have turned aside to vain jangling, 7 Desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say, nor concerning what they affirm.

8 But we know that the law is good if a man uses it lawfully, 9 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for man-slayers, 10 For lewd persons, for those who defile themselves with mankind, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, 11 According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.

12 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry. 13 I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious, but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. 14 And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 15 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation: that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. 16 However, for this cause I obtained mercy, so that in me as chief, Jesus Christ might show forth all his patience for an example to those who should hereafter believe in him to eternal life. 17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, God the only wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

18 This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before to you, so that by them you may war a good warfare, 19 Holding faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away, have made shipwreck concerning faith, 20 Of whom are Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul gives direction to pray and give thanks for all men, and the reason why, 1-7. The duties of men and women respectively concerning public prayer, 8-10. Women are not permitted to teach, 11-14. And a promise given for their encouragement in child-bearing, 15._

1 I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, 2 For kings, and for all who are in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 4 Who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 6 Who gave himself a ransom for all—the testimony in its own due times, 7 For which I am ordained a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, and do not lie), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

8 I wish therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

9 In like manner also, [I wish] that women adorn themselves in decent apparel with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or costly array, 10 But (which is proper for women professing godliness) with good works. 11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. 12 But I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. 13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and fell into transgression. 15 But she will be saved in child-bearing, if they continue in faith, charity, and holiness, with sobriety.

_How overseers and deacons should be qualified, 1-13; and to what end Paul wrote to Timothy about these things, 14. Of the church, and the blessed truth therein taught and professed, 15, 16._

1 This is a true saying: if a man desires the office of an overseer, he desires a good work. 2 An overseer then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach, 3 Not given to wine, not quarrelsome, not greedy of filthy lucre, but patient, not a brawler, not covetous, 4 One who rules his own house well, having his children in subjection with all gravity 5 (For if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?), 6 Not a novice, lest, being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil. 7 Moreover, he must have a good report with those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

8 Likewise, the deacons must be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre, 9 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 10 And let these also first be proved. Then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. 11 Likewise, their wives must be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. 12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. 13 For those who have used the office of a deacon well, purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith, which is in Christ Jesus.

14 These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly. 15 But if I delay, [I write] so that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. 16 And without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great.

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul foretells that in the latter times there shall be a departure from the faith, 1-5. And to the end that Timothy might not fail in doing his duty, he furnishes him with various precepts belonging thereto, 6-16._

1 Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron, 3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused, if received with thanksgiving, 5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

6 If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of faith and of good doctrine, to which you have attained. 7 But refuse profane and old wives' fables and exercise yourself rather to godliness. 8 For bodily exercise profits little, but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come. 9 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. 10 For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.

11 Command and teach these things. 12 Let no man despise your youth, but be an example of the believers in word, in deportment, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity. 13 Until I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine. [[fti004-014]]14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 15 Meditate upon these things. Give yourself wholly to them so that your profiting may appear to all. 16 Take heed to yourself and to your doctrine. Continue in them. For in doing this you will both save yourself and those who hear you.

_Rules to be observed in reproving, 1, 2. Of widows, 3-16. Of elders, 17-22. A precept for Timothy's health, 23. Some men's sins go before to judgment and some men's sins follow after, 24, 25._

1 Do not rebuke an elder, but entreat him as a father, and the younger men as brothers, 2 The elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all purity.

3 Honor widows who are widows indeed. 4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to requite their parents, for that is good and acceptable before God. 5 Now she who is a widow indeed and desolate trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. 6 But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives. 7 And these things give in charge, so that they may be blameless. 8 But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.

9 Let a woman be enrolled as a widow not under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man, 10 Well reported of for good works, if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work. 11 But refuse the younger widows, for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they will marry, 12 Having condemnation, because they have cast off their first faith. 13 And at the same time, they learn to be idle, wandering around from house to house, and not only idle, but tattlers also, and busy-bodies, speaking things which they ought not. 14 I wish therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, and give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. 15 For some are already turned aside after Satan. 16 If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be charged, so that it may relieve those who are widows indeed.

17 Let the elders who lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine. [[fti005-018]]18 For the Scripture says, "_You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain,_" and, "The laborer is worthy of his hire." 19 Do not receive an accusation against an elder, except before two or three witnesses. 20 Rebuke those who sin in the sight of all so that others may also fear. 21 I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. 22 Do not hastily lay hands on any man, neither be partaker of other men's sins. Keep yourself pure.

23 No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities.

24 Some men's sins are evident, going before them to judgment, and for some men, they follow after. 25 Likewise also, the good works of some are evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hid.

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_Of the duty of servants, 1, 2. Not to have fellowship with newfangled teachers, 3-5. Godliness is great gain, 6-9; and love of money the root of all evil, 10. From what Timothy is to flee and what he is to follow, 11-16; and of what he is to admonish the rich, 17-19. He is to keep the purity of true doctrine and to avoid profane babblings, 20, 21._

1 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor so that the name of God and his doctrine may not be blasphemed. 2 And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brothers, but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. Teach and exhort these things.

3 If any man teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the doctrine which is according to godliness, 4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, from which comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness. Withdraw yourself from such. 6 But godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. 8 And having food and clothing, with these let us be content. 9 But those who wish to be rich fall into temptation, a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition. 10 For the love of money is the root of all evil, which, while some have coveted, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

11 But you, O man of God, flee from these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness. 12 Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of eternal life to which you are also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses. 13 I give you charge in the sight of God, who makes all things alive, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified a good confession, 14 That you keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 Which at the right time he will show who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, 16 Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach, whom no man has seen, nor can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen.

17 Charge those who are rich in this world, that they not be high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. 18 Charge them to do good and that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, 19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, so that they may take hold of eternal life.

20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge, 21 Which some, professing, have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
