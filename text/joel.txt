== The Word of the Lord to Joel

*Joel | Ἰωήλ | יואל*

[#joe001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_Joel, declaring various judgments of God, exhorts to observe them, 1-7, and to mourn, 8-13. He prescribes a solemn fast to deprecate those judgments, 14-20._

1 [_The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel._]

2 Hear this, you old men, [.linebr]#/# +
and give ear, all you inhabitants of the land. [.linebr]#/# +
Has this been in your days, [.linebr]#/# +
or even in the days of your fathers?

3 Tell your children of it, [.linebr]#/# +
and let your children tell their children, [.linebr]#/# +
and their children another generation.

4 That which the cutting-locust has left [.linebr]#/# +
the swarming-locust has eaten, [.linebr]#/# +
that which the swarming-locust has left [.linebr]#/# +
the licking-locust has eaten, [.linebr]#/# +
and that which the licking-locust has left [.linebr]#/# +
the ravaging-locust has eaten.

5 Awake, you drunkards, and weep. [.linebr]#/# +
Howl, all you drinkers of wine, [.linebr]#/# +
because of the new wine, [.linebr]#/# +
for it is cut off from your mouth.

6 For a nation has come up upon my land, [.linebr]#/# +
strong and without number, [.linebr]#/# +
whose teeth are the teeth of a lion [.linebr]#/# +
and he has the cheek teeth of a great lion.

7 He has laid my vine waste [.linebr]#/# +
and barked my fig-tree. [.linebr]#/# +
He has made it thoroughly bare and cast it away. [.linebr]#/# +
Its branches are made white.

8 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth [.linebr]#/# +
for the husband of her youth.

9 The food-offering and the drink-offering are cut off [.linebr]#/# +
from the house of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
The priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.

10 The field is wasted [.linebr]#/# +
and the land mourns, [.linebr]#/# +
for the grain is wasted. [.linebr]#/# +
The new wine is dried up. [.linebr]#/# +
The oil languishes.

11 Be ashamed, O farmers. [.linebr]#/# +
Howl, O vine-dressers, [.linebr]#/# +
for the wheat and for the barley, [.linebr]#/# +
because the harvest of the field has perished.

12 The vine is dried up [.linebr]#/# +
and the fig-tree languishes. [.linebr]#/# +
The pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree, and the apple-tree, [.linebr]#/# +
even all the trees of the field are withered, [.linebr]#/# +
because joy has withered away from the sons of men.

13 Gird yourselves and lament, you priests. [.linebr]#/# +
Howl, you ministers of the altar. [.linebr]#/# +
Come, lie all night in sackcloth, [.linebr]#/# +
you ministers of my God, [.linebr]#/# +
for the food-offering and the drink-offering are withheld [.linebr]#/# +
from the house of your God.

14 Sanctify a fast, [.linebr]#/# +
call a solemn assembly, [.linebr]#/# +
gather the elders [.linebr]#/# +
and all the inhabitants of the land [.linebr]#/# +
into the house of the LORD your God, [.linebr]#/# +
and cry to the LORD.

15 Alas for the day! [.linebr]#/# +
For the day of the LORD is at hand, [.linebr]#/# +
and as a destruction from the Almighty it shall come.

16 Is the food not cut off [.linebr]#/# +
before our eyes, [.linebr]#/# +
and joy and gladness [.linebr]#/# +
from the house of our God?

17 The seed has perished under their clods, [.linebr]#/# +
the granaries are laid desolate, [.linebr]#/# +
and the barns are broken down, [.linebr]#/# +
for the grain has withered.

18 How the beasts groan! [.linebr]#/# +
The herds of livestock are perplexed [.linebr]#/# +
because they have no pasture. [.linebr]#/# +
Even the flocks of sheep are made desolate.

19 O LORD, I will cry to you, [.linebr]#/# +
for the fire has devoured [.linebr]#/# +
the pastures of the wilderness [.linebr]#/# +
and the flame has burned [.linebr]#/# +
all the trees of the field.

20 The beasts of the field also cry to you, [.linebr]#/# +
for the rivers of waters are dried up [.linebr]#/# +
and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_He shows to Zion the terribleness of God's judgment, 1-11. He exhorts to repentance, 12-14; prescribes a fast, 15-17; promises a blessing thereon, 18-20. He comforts Zion with present, 21-27, and future blessings, 28-32._

1 Blow the trumpet in Zion [.linebr]#/# +
and sound an alarm on my holy mountain. [.linebr]#/# +
Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, [.linebr]#/# +
for the day of the LORD comes. [.linebr]#/# +
It is near at hand,

2 A day of darkness and of gloominess, [.linebr]#/# +
a day of clouds and of thick darkness. [.linebr]#/# +
As the morning spreading upon the mountains, [.linebr]#/# +
so there is a great and strong people. [.linebr]#/# +
There has never been the like, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall there be any more after it, [.linebr]#/# +
even to the years of many generations.

3 A fire devours before them, [.linebr]#/# +
and behind them a flame burns. [.linebr]#/# +
The land is as the garden of Eden before them, [.linebr]#/# +
and behind them a desolate wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
and nothing shall escape them.

4 Their appearance is as the appearance of horses. [.linebr]#/# +
And as horsemen, so they shall run.

5 Like the noise of chariots [.linebr]#/# +
on the tops of mountains they shall leap, [.linebr]#/# +
like the noise of a flame of fire [.linebr]#/# +
that devours the stubble, [.linebr]#/# +
as a strong people set in battle array.

6 Before their face the people shall be much pained. [.linebr]#/# +
All faces shall gather blackness.

7 They shall run like mighty men. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall climb the wall like men of war. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall each march on his ways [.linebr]#/# +
and shall not break their ranks,

8 Neither shall one thrust another. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall each walk in his path. [.linebr]#/# +
And when they fall upon the sword, [.linebr]#/# +
they shall not be wounded.

9 They shall run to and fro in the city. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall run upon the wall. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall climb upon the houses. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall enter in at the windows like a thief.

10 The earth shall quake before them. [.linebr]#/# +
The heavens shall tremble. [.linebr]#/# +
The sun and the moon shall be dark, [.linebr]#/# +
and the stars shall withdraw their shining.

11 And the LORD will utter his voice before his army, [.linebr]#/# +
for his camp is very great, [.linebr]#/# +
and he is strong who executes his word. [.linebr]#/# +
For the day of the LORD is great and very terrible. [.linebr]#/# +
Who can endure it?

12 "Yet even now," says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"turn to me with all your heart, [.linebr]#/# +
with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning."

13 And rend your heart and not your garments, [.linebr]#/# +
and turn to the LORD your God, [.linebr]#/# +
for he is gracious and merciful, [.linebr]#/# +
slow to anger, and of great kindness, [.linebr]#/# +
and repents of the evil.

14 Who knows if he will return and repent [.linebr]#/# +
and leave a blessing behind him, [.linebr]#/# +
even a food-offering and a drink-offering [.linebr]#/# +
to the LORD your God?

15 Blow the trumpet in Zion. Sanctify a fast. [.linebr]#/# +
Call a solemn assembly.

16 Gather the people. [.linebr]#/# +
Sanctify the congregation. [.linebr]#/# +
Assemble the elders. [.linebr]#/# +
Gather the children [.linebr]#/# +
and those who nurse from the breasts. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the bridegroom go forth from his room [.linebr]#/# +
and the bride out of her chamber.

17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
weep between the porch and the altar, [.linebr]#/# +
and let them say, "Spare your people, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not give your heritage to reproach [.linebr]#/# +
so that the heathen should rule over them. [.linebr]#/# +
Why should they say among the people, [.linebr]#/# +
'Where is their God?'"

18 Then the LORD will be jealous for his land [.linebr]#/# +
and pity his people.

19 And the LORD will answer and say to his people, [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold, I will send you grain, wine, and oil, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall be satisfied with it, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will no longer make you [.linebr]#/# +
a reproach among the heathen.

20 But I will remove far from you the northern army [.linebr]#/# +
and drive him into a land barren and desolate [.linebr]#/# +
with his face toward the east sea [.linebr]#/# +
and his back parts toward the utmost sea, [.linebr]#/# +
and his odious scent shall come up [.linebr]#/# +
and his ill savor shall come up, [.linebr]#/# +
because he has worked proudly."

21 Do not fear, O land. Be glad and rejoice, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD will do great things.

22 Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field, [.linebr]#/# +
for the pastures of the wilderness spring, [.linebr]#/# +
the tree bears its fruit, [.linebr]#/# +
and the fig-tree and the vine yield their strength.

23 Be glad then, children of Zion, [.linebr]#/# +
and rejoice in the LORD your God, [.linebr]#/# +
for he has given you the former rain moderately. [.linebr]#/# +
He will cause to come down for you the rain, [.linebr]#/# +
the former rain and the latter rain, in the first month.

24 And the floors shall be full of wheat [.linebr]#/# +
and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.

25 "And I will restore to you the years [.linebr]#/# +
that the swarming-locust, [.linebr]#/# +
the licking-locust, the ravaging-locust, [.linebr]#/# +
and the cutting-locust consumed— [.linebr]#/# +
my great army which I sent among you.

26 And you shall eat in plenty, be satisfied, [.linebr]#/# +
and praise the name of the LORD your God, [.linebr]#/# +
who has dealt wondrously with you. [.linebr]#/# +
And my people shall never be ashamed.

27 And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel [.linebr]#/# +
and that I am the LORD your God, and no one else. [.linebr]#/# +
And my people shall never be ashamed.

[[joe002-028]]28 And it shall come to pass afterward, [.linebr]#/# +
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, [.linebr]#/# +
and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, [.linebr]#/# +
your old men shall dream dreams, [.linebr]#/# +
your young men shall see visions.

[[joe002-029]]29 And also upon the men-servants [.linebr]#/# +
and upon the women-servants [.linebr]#/# +
in those days I will pour out my Spirit.

[[joe002-030]]30 And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth: [.linebr]#/# +
blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.

[[joe002-031]]31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, [.linebr]#/# +
and the moon into blood, [.linebr]#/# +
before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes.

[[joe002-032]]32 And it shall come to pass, [.linebr]#/# +
that whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be delivered. [.linebr]#/# +
For on mount Zion and in Jerusalem [.linebr]#/# +
there shall be deliverance, [.linebr]#/# +
as the LORD has said, [.linebr]#/# +
and in the remnant whom the LORD calls."

|1 "For behold, in those days and in that time, [.linebr]#/# +
when I bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,

|
|2 I will also gather all nations [.linebr]#/# +
and bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat. [.linebr]#/# +
I will plead with them there [.linebr]#/# +
for my people and for my heritage Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
whom they have scattered among the nations, [.linebr]#/# +
and divided my land.

|
|3 And they have cast lots for my people, [.linebr]#/# +
have given a boy for a harlot, [.linebr]#/# +
and sold a girl for wine so that they might drink.

4 "And what do you even have to do with me, O Tyre, Zidon, and all the regions of Palestine? Will you render me a recompense? And if you recompense me, swiftly and speedily I will return your recompense upon your own head, 5 Because you have taken my silver and my gold and have carried my finest treasures into your temples. 6 You have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the Grecians, so that you might remove them far from their border. 7 Behold, I will raise them out of the place where you have sold them and will return your recompense upon your own head. 8 And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off. For the LORD has spoken it."

|9 Proclaim this among the Gentiles: [.linebr]#/# +
"Prepare for war. [.linebr]#/# +
Wake up the mighty men. [.linebr]#/# +
Let all the men of war draw near. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them come up.

|
|10 Beat your plow-shares into swords [.linebr]#/# +
and your pruning-hooks into spears. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the weak say, 'I am strong.'

|
|11 Assemble yourselves and come, all you heathen, [.linebr]#/# +
and gather yourselves together around." [.linebr]#/# +
Cause your mighty ones to come down there, O LORD.

|
|12 "Let the heathen be awakened and come up [.linebr]#/# +
to the valley of Jehoshaphat, [.linebr]#/# +
for there I will sit to judge [.linebr]#/# +
all the heathen on every side.

for the harvest is ripe. [.linebr]#/# +
Come, tread, [.linebr]#/# +
for the press is full. [.linebr]#/# +
The vats overflow, [.linebr]#/# +
for their wickedness is great."

|14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision, [.linebr]#/# +
for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.

and the heavens and the earth shall shake. [.linebr]#/# +
But the LORD will be the hope of his people [.linebr]#/# +

|17 "And you shall know that I am the LORD your God [.linebr]#/# +
dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. [.linebr]#/# +
Then Jerusalem shall be holy, [.linebr]#/# +
and no strangers shall pass through her anymore.

|

that the mountains shall drop down new wine, [.linebr]#/# +
the hills shall flow with milk, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, [.linebr]#/# +
and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and shall water the valley of Shittim.

|
|19 Egypt shall be a desolation [.linebr]#/# +
and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness [.linebr]#/# +
for the violence against the children of Judah, [.linebr]#/# +
because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

|
|20 But Judah shall dwell forever, [.linebr]#/# +
and Jerusalem from generation to generation.

|
|21 For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed. [.linebr]#/# +
For the LORD dwells in Zion."
