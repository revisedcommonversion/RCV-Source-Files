_Nehemiah, understanding by Hanani the misery of Jerusalem, mourns, fasts, and prays, 1-4. His prayer, 5-11._

1 [_The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah._] And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in the palace of Shushan, 2 That Hanani, one of my brothers, came—he and some men of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 3 And they said to me, "The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down and its gates are burned with fire."

4 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept. And I mourned for some days, fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, 5 And said, "I implore you, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and mercy for those who love him and observe his commandments, 6 Let your ear now be attentive and your eyes open so that you may hear the prayer of your servant which I pray before you now day and night for the children of Israel your servants. I confess the sins of the children of Israel that we have sinned against you. Both I and my father's house have sinned. 7 We have dealt very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments which you commanded your servant Moses. 8 Remember, I implore you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, 'If you transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations, 9 But if you turn to me and keep my commandments and do them, though there were some of you driven to the uttermost part of the heaven, yet I will gather them from there and will bring them to the place where I have chosen to set my name.' 10 Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. 11 O Lord, I implore you, now let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who desire to fear your name. And prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man." (I was the king's cup-bearer.)

_Artaxerxes, understanding the cause of Nehemiah's sadness, sends him with letters and commission to Jerusalem, 1-8. Nehemiah, to the grief of the enemies, comes to Jerusalem, 9-11. He views secretly the ruins of the walls, 12-16. He incites the Jews to build, 17-20._

1 And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him. And I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not before been sad in his presence. 2 Therefore, the king said to me, "Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart." Then I was very greatly afraid, 3 And said to the king, "Let the king live forever. Why should my countenance not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lies waste and its gates are consumed with fire?" 4 Then the king said to me, "For what do you make request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven. 5 And I said to the king, "If it should please the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchers, so that I may build it." 6 And the king said to me (the queen also sitting by him), "For how long shall your journey be? And when will you return?" So it pleased the king to send me, and I set him a time. 7 Moreover, I said to the king, "If it should please the king, let letters be given to me for the governors beyond the river so that they may convey me over until I come into Judah, 8 And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest so that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which belonged to the house, for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter." And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

9 Then I came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. 10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

11 So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days. 12 And I arose in the night—I and a few men with me—neither did I tell any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem, neither was there any beast with me, except the beast that I rode upon. 13 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon-well and to the dung-port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down and their gates were consumed with fire. 14 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain and to the king's pool, but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass. 15 Then I went up in the night by the brook, viewed the wall, turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned. 16 And the rulers did not know where I went or what I did, for I had not yet told it to the Jews, to the priests, to the nobles, to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work.

17 Then I said to them, "You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste and its gates are burned with fire. Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem so that we may no more be a reproach." 18 Then I told them about the hand of my God which was good upon me and about the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, "Let us rise and build." So they strengthened their hands for this good work. 19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arabian heard it, they laughed us to scorn and despised us, and said, "What is this thing that you do? Will you rebel against the king?" 20 Then I answered them, and said to them, "The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore, we his servants will arise and build. But you have no portion, right, nor memorial in Jerusalem."

_The names and order of those who built the wall, 1-32._

1 Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep-gate. They sanctified it and set up its doors. Even to the tower of Meah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananeel. 2 And next to him the men of Jericho built. And next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.

_While the enemies scoff, Nehemiah prays and continues the work, 1-6. Understanding the wrath and secrets of the enemy, he sets a watch, 7-12. He arms the laborers, 13-18; and gives military precepts, 19-23._

1 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. 2 And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they make an end in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of debris which are burned?" 3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, "Even that which they build, if a fox should go up, he would even break down their stone wall."

4 Hear, O our God, for we are despised. And turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for plunder in the land of captivity. 5 And do not cover their iniquity and do not let their sin be blotted out from before you, for they have provoked you to anger before the builders.

6 So we built the wall. And all the wall was joined together to the half of it, for the people had a mind to work.

7 But it came to pass, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were set up and that the breaches began to be stopped, they were very angry, 8 And all of them conspired together to come and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it.

9 Nevertheless, we made our prayer to our God and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.

10 And Judah said, "The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading and there is much debris. We are not able to build the wall."

11 And our adversaries said, "They shall not know, neither see, until we come in the midst among them, slay them, and cause the work to cease." 12 And it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, "From all places where you shall return to us they will be upon you." 13 Therefore, I set in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. 14 And I looked, arose, and said to the nobles, to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, "Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses."

15 And it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known to us and that God had brought their counsel to nothing, that all of us returned to the wall, each to his work. 16 And it came to pass from that time forth, that one half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows, and the habergeons. And the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. 17 Those who built the wall and those who carried loads, as they were loaded, each did the work with one of his hands, and with the other hand held a weapon. 18 For each of the builders had his sword girded by his side, and in this manner built. And he who sounded the trumpet was by me. 19 And I said to the nobles, to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, "The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another. 20 In what place therefore you hear the sound of the trumpet, resort there to us. Our God will fight for us."

21 Thus we labored in the work. And half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared. 22 And at the same time I said to the people, "Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, so that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor in the day." 23 Thus neither I, my brothers, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes, except that everyone took them off for washing.

_The Jews bewail their debt, mortgage, and bondage, 1-5. Nehemiah rebukes those who exact interest, and causes them to make a covenant of restitution, 6-13. He forbears his own allowance, and keeps hospitality, 14-19._

1 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews. 2 For there were some who said, "We, our sons, and our daughters are many. Therefore, we take up grain for them so that we may eat and live." 3 There were also some who said, "We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses so that we might buy grain because of the famine." 4 There were also some who said, "We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that is upon our lands and vineyards. 5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children. And behold, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already, neither is it in our power to redeem them, for other men have our lands and vineyards."

6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. 7 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, "You exact interest, each from his brother." And I set a great assembly against them. 8 And I said to them, "We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews who were sold to the heathen. And will you even sell your brothers? Or shall they be sold to us?" Then they held their peace and found nothing to answer. 9 Also I said, "That which you do is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? 10 I likewise, my brothers and my servants, might exact from them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury. 11 I pray you, restore to them even this day their lands, their vineyards, their olive-groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the wine, and the oil that you exact from them." 12 Then they said, "We will restore them and will require nothing from them. We will do so as you say." Then I called the priests and bound them by oath that they would do according to this promise. 13 Also I shook my lap, and said, "In this manner may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not perform this promise. Even in this manner may he be shaken out and emptied." And all the congregation said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.

14 Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king (that is, twelve years), I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor. 15 But the former governors who had been before me were burdensome to the people and had taken from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. And even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not do so, because of the fear of God. 16 And I also continued in the work of this wall, neither did we buy any land. And all my servants were gathered there to the work. 17 Moreover, there were at my table one hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from among the heathen who were around us. 18 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep, birds were also prepared for me, and once in ten days an abundance of all sorts of wine. Yet for all this I did not require the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. 19 Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.

_Sanballat practices by craft, by rumors, and by hired prophecies to terrify Nehemiah, 1-14. The work is finished, to the terror of the enemies, 15, 16. Secret intelligence passes between the enemies and the nobles of Judah, 17-19._

1 Now it came to pass when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates), 2 That Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, "Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono." But they thought to do me mischief. 3 And I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?" 4 Yet they sent to me four times after this sort, and I answered them after the same manner. 5 Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand, 6 In which this was written: "It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause you build the wall so that you may be their king, according to these words. 7 And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim about you at Jerusalem, saying, 'There is a king in Judah.' And now it shall be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together." 8 Then I sent to him, saying, "There are no such things done as you say, but you feign them out of your own heart." 9 For they all made us afraid, saying, "Their hands shall be weakened from the work, and it will not be done." Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.

10 Afterward, I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up. And he said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple, for they will come to slay you. Indeed, in the night they will come to slay you." 11 And I said, "Should such a man as I flee? And who is there who, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in." 12 And behold, I perceived that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced this prophecy against me, for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 13 Therefore, he was hired so that I should be afraid and do so and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report so that they might reproach me. 14 My God, think upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and on the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have put me in fear.

15 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days. 16 And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it and all the heathen who were around us saw these things, that they were much cast down in their own eyes, for they perceived that this work was wrought by our God. 17 Moreover, in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them. 18 For there were many in Judah bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. 19 Also, they reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

_Nehemiah commits the charge of Jerusalem to Hanani and Hananiah, 1-4. A register of the genealogy of those who came at the first out of Babylon, 5-8; of the people, 9-38; of the priests, 39-42; of the Levites, 43-45; of the Nethinims, 46-56; of Solomon's servants, 57-62; and of the priests who could not find their pedigree, 63-65. The whole number of them, with their substance, 66-69. Their oblations, 70-73._

1 Now it came to pass when the wall was built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites were appointed, 2 That I gave my brother Hanani and Hananiah the ruler of the palace charge over Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God above many. 3 And I said to them, "Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot. And while they stand by, let them shut the doors and bar them. And appoint watches from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each in his watch and each to be over against his house." 4 Now the city was large and great, but the people in it were few, and the houses were not built.

5 And my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, the rulers, and the people, so that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and found this written in it:

6 These are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came back to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his city, 7 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel was this: 8 The children of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two; 9 The children of Shephatiah, three hundred and seventy-two; 10 The children of Arah, six hundred and fifty-two; 11 The children of Pahath-moab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and eighteen; 12 The children of Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four; 13 The children of Zattu, eight hundred and forty five; 14 The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and sixty; 15 The children of Binnui, six hundred and forty-eight; 16 The children of Bebai, six hundred and twenty-eight; 17 The children of Azgad, two thousand three hundred and twenty-two; 18 The children of Adonikam, six hundred and sixty-seven; 19 The children of Bigvai, two thousand and sixty-seven; 20 The children of Adin, six hundred and fifty-five; 21 The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety-eight; 22 The children of Hashum, three hundred and twenty-eight; 23 The children of Bezai, three hundred and twenty-four; 24 The children of Hariph, one hundred and twelve; 25 The children of Gibeon, ninety-five; 26 The men of Beth-lehem and Netophah, one hundred and eighty-eight; 27 The men of Anathoth, one hundred and twenty-eight; 28 The men of Beth-azmaveth, forty-two; 29 The men of Kirjath-jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty-three; 30 The men of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred and twenty-one; 31 The men of Michmas, one hundred and twenty-two; 32 The men of Beth-el and Ai, one hundred and twenty-three; 33 The men of the other Nebo, fifty-two; 34 The children of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four; 35 The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty; 36 The children of Jericho, three hundred and forty-five; 37 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred and twenty-one; 38 The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.

39 The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred and seventy-three; 40 The children of Immer, one thousand and fifty-two; 41 The children of Pashur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven; 42 The children of Harim, one thousand and seventeen.

43 The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the children of Hodevah, seventy-four. 44 The singers: the children of Asaph, one hundred and forty-eight. 45 The gatekeepers: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, and the children of Shobai, one hundred and thirty-eight.

46 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha, the children of Tabbaoth, 47 The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon, 48 The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of Shalmai, 49 The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, 50 The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, 51 The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Phaseah, 52 The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephishesim, 53 The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur, 54 The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha, 55 The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Tamah, 56 The children of Neziah, and the children of Hatipha.

57 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida, 58 The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel, 59 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, and the children of Amon.

60 All the Nethinims and the children of Solomon's servants were three hundred and ninety-two.

61 And these were those who went up also from Tel-mela, Tel-haresha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not show their fathers' house, nor their genealogy, whether they were of Israel. 62 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, and the children of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two. 63 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, and the children of Barzillai, who took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite for a wife and was called after their name. 64 These sought their register among those who were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found. Therefore, they were deemed polluted and taken from the priesthood. 65 And the Tirshatha said to them that they should not eat the most holy things until there should stand up a priest with Urim and Thummim.

66 The whole congregation together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty, 67 Besides their men-servants and their women-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. And they had two hundred and forty five singing-men and singing-women. 68 Their horses, seven hundred and thirty-six; their mules, two hundred and forty-five; 69 Their camels, four hundred and thirty-five; and their donkeys, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.

70 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure one thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, and five hundred and thirty priests' garments. 71 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasury for the work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand and two hundred minas of silver. 72 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, two thousand minas of silver, and sixty-seven priests' garments.

73 So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the Nethinims, and all Israel dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.

And they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel. 2 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation, both of men and women and all who could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. 3 And he read therein before the street that was before the water-gate from the morning until mid-day in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. 4 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for this purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand, and on his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchiah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam. 5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people). And when he opened it, all the people stood up. 6 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, "Amen, Amen," with lifting their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground. 7 Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites caused the people to understand the law. And the people stood in their place. 8 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, giving the sense so that they understood the reading.

[[neh008-009]]9 And Nehemiah the Tirshatha, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, "This day is holy to the LORD your God. Do not mourn, nor weep." For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law. 10 Then he said to them, "Go your way, eat the fat and drink what is sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared. For this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be sad, for the joy of the LORD is your strength." 11 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, "Hold your peace, for the day is holy. Do not be grieved." 12 And all the people went their way to eat, to drink, to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.

13 And on the second day the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were assembled to Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law. 14 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month, 15 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, "Go forth to the mountain and fetch olive branches, pine branches, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of thick trees to make booths, as it is written." 16 So the people went forth, brought them, and made themselves booths, each upon the roof of his house, in their courts, in the courts of the house of God, in the street of the water-gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim. 17 And all the congregation of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and sat under the booths, for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day, the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness. 18 Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days, and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the manner.

_A solemn fast, and repentance of the people, 1-3. The Levites make a religious confession of God's goodness, and their wickedness, 4-38._

1 Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting and with sackcloth and earth upon them. 2 And the offspring of Israel separated themselves from all strangers and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. 3 And they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God for one fourth part of the day, and for another fourth part they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God. 4 Then, of the Levites, Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood upon the stairs and cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God.

5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, "Stand up and bless the LORD your God forever and ever:

|Blessed be your glorious name, [.linebr]#/# +
which is exalted [.linebr]#/# +
above all blessing and praise.

|
|6 You are Yahweh, even you alone. [.linebr]#/# +
You have made heaven, [.linebr]#/# +
the heaven of heavens with all their host, [.linebr]#/# +
the earth and all things that are in it, [.linebr]#/# +
the seas and all that is in them, [.linebr]#/# +
and you preserve them all. [.linebr]#/# +
And the host of heaven worships you.

|
|7 You are the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
the God who chose Abram, [.linebr]#/# +
brought him forth from Ur of the Chaldeans, [.linebr]#/# +
and gave him the name of Abraham,

|
|8 And found his heart faithful before you [.linebr]#/# +
and made a covenant with him, [.linebr]#/# +
to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, [.linebr]#/# +
the Amorites, the Perizzites, [.linebr]#/# +
the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, [.linebr]#/# +
to give it to his offspring, [.linebr]#/# +
and have performed your words, [.linebr]#/# +
for you are righteous.

|
|9 And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt [.linebr]#/# +
and heard their cry by the Red Sea,

|
|10 And showed signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, [.linebr]#/# +
upon all his servants, and upon all the people of his land, [.linebr]#/# +
for you knew that they dealt proudly against them. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus you made yourself a name, [.linebr]#/# +
as it is this day.

|
|11 And you divided the sea before them [.linebr]#/# +
so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land. [.linebr]#/# +
And you threw their persecutors into the depths, [.linebr]#/# +
as a stone into the mighty waters.

|
|12 Moreover, you led them in the day by a cloudy pillar [.linebr]#/# +
and in the night by a pillar of fire, [.linebr]#/# +
to give them light in the way [.linebr]#/# +
in which they should go.

|
|13 You came down also upon mount Sinai, [.linebr]#/# +
spoke with them from heaven, [.linebr]#/# +
and gave them right judgments, true laws, [.linebr]#/# +
good statutes, and commandments,

|
|14 And made your holy sabbath known to them, [.linebr]#/# +
and commanded them precepts, statutes, and laws, [.linebr]#/# +
by the hand of Moses your servant,

|
|15 And gave them bread from heaven for their hunger [.linebr]#/# +
and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, [.linebr]#/# +
and promised them that they should go in to possess the land [.linebr]#/# +
which you had sworn to give them.

|
|16 But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks [.linebr]#/# +
and did not listen to your commandments.

|
|17 And they refused to obey, neither were they mindful [.linebr]#/# +
of your wonders that you performed among them, [.linebr]#/# +
but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain [.linebr]#/# +
to return to their bondage. [.linebr]#/# +
But you are a God ready to pardon, [.linebr]#/# +
gracious and merciful, [.linebr]#/# +
slow to anger, and of great kindness, [.linebr]#/# +
and did not forsake them.

|
|18 Indeed, when they had made themselves [.linebr]#/# +
a molten calf, and said, [.linebr]#/# +
'This is your God who brought you out of Egypt,' [.linebr]#/# +
and had wrought great provocations,

|
|19 Yet you in your manifold mercies [.linebr]#/# +
did not forsake them in the wilderness. [.linebr]#/# +
The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day [.linebr]#/# +
to lead them in the way, [.linebr]#/# +
neither the pillar of fire by night to show them light [.linebr]#/# +
and the way in which they should go.

|
|20 You also gave your good Spirit to instruct them. [.linebr]#/# +
You did not withhold your manna from their mouth, [.linebr]#/# +
and you gave them water for their thirst.

|
|21 Indeed, for forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
and they lacked nothing. [.linebr]#/# +
Their clothes did not grow old [.linebr]#/# +
and their feet did not swell.

|
|22 Moreover, you gave them kingdoms and nations [.linebr]#/# +
and divided them into corners. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus they possessed the land of Sihon, [.linebr]#/# +
the land of the king of Heshbon, [.linebr]#/# +
and the land of Og king of Bashan.

|
|23 Their children you also multiplied [.linebr]#/# +
as the stars of heaven [.linebr]#/# +
and brought them into the land, [.linebr]#/# +
concerning which you had promised to their fathers [.linebr]#/# +
that they should go in to possess it.

|
|24 Thus the children went in and possessed the land, [.linebr]#/# +
and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, [.linebr]#/# +
and gave them into their hands, with their kings and the people of the land, [.linebr]#/# +
so that they might do with them as they wished.

|
|25 And they took strong cities and a fat land [.linebr]#/# +
and possessed houses full of all goods, [.linebr]#/# +
wells dug, vineyards and olive-groves, [.linebr]#/# +
and fruit trees in abundance. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus they ate and were filled [.linebr]#/# +
and became fat and delighted themselves in your great goodness.

|
|26 Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against you, [.linebr]#/# +
and they cast your law behind their backs [.linebr]#/# +
and slew your prophets who testified against them to turn them to you, [.linebr]#/# +
and they wrought great provocations.

|
|27 Therefore, you delivered them into the hand [.linebr]#/# +
of their enemies who distressed them. [.linebr]#/# +
And in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, [.linebr]#/# +
you heard them from heaven. [.linebr]#/# +
And according to your manifold mercies you gave them deliverers [.linebr]#/# +
who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.

|
|28 But after they had rest, [.linebr]#/# +
they did evil again before you; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, you left them in the hand of their enemies, [.linebr]#/# +
so that they had the dominion over them. [.linebr]#/# +
Yet when they returned and cried to you, [.linebr]#/# +
you heard them from heaven, [.linebr]#/# +
and many times you delivered them [.linebr]#/# +
according to your mercies.

|
|29 You testified against them so that you might bring them back to your law. [.linebr]#/# +
Yet they dealt proudly and did not listen to your commandments, [.linebr]#/# +
but sinned against your judgments [.linebr]#/# +
(which if a man does, he shall live in them), [.linebr]#/# +
withdrew the shoulder, [.linebr]#/# +
hardened their neck, and would not hear.

|
|30 Yet many years you forbore over them [.linebr]#/# +
and testified against them by your Spirit in your prophets. [.linebr]#/# +
Yet they would not give ear. [.linebr]#/# +
Therefore, you gave them into the hand of the people of the lands.

|
|31 Nevertheless, for your great mercies' sake [.linebr]#/# +
you did not utterly consume them, [.linebr]#/# +
nor forsake them, [.linebr]#/# +
for you are a gracious and merciful God.

|
|32 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, [.linebr]#/# +
and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and mercy, [.linebr]#/# +
do not let all the trouble seem little before you [.linebr]#/# +
that has come upon us, [.linebr]#/# +
on our kings, on our princes, [.linebr]#/# +
on our priests, on our prophets, [.linebr]#/# +
on our fathers, and on all your people [.linebr]#/# +
since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.

|
|33 But you are just in all that is brought upon us. [.linebr]#/# +
For you have done right, [.linebr]#/# +
but we have done wickedly.

|
|34 Neither our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers [.linebr]#/# +
have kept your law [.linebr]#/# +
nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies [.linebr]#/# +
with which you testified against them.

|
|35 For they have not served you in their kingdom, [.linebr]#/# +
and in your great goodness that you gave them, [.linebr]#/# +
and in the large and fat land which you gave before them, [.linebr]#/# +
neither did they turn from their wicked works.

|
|36 Behold, we are servants this day, [.linebr]#/# +
and for the land that you gave to our fathers [.linebr]#/# +
to eat its fruit and its good, [.linebr]#/# +
behold, we are servants in it.

|
|37 And it yields much increase to the kings [.linebr]#/# +
whom you have set over us because of our sins. [.linebr]#/# +
They also have dominion over our bodies [.linebr]#/# +
and over our livestock at their pleasure, [.linebr]#/# +
and we are in great distress.

28 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Nethinims, and all those who had separated themselves from the people of the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, everyone having knowledge and having understanding, 29 They united with their brothers, their nobles, and entered into a curse and into an oath to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, his judgments, and his statutes, 30 And that we would not give our daughters to the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons; 31 And if the people of the land should bring wares or any provisions on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it from them on the sabbath or on the holy day; and that we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.

32 We also made ordinances for ourselves to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God: 33 For the show-bread, for the continual food-offering, for the continual burnt-offering, for the sabbaths, for the new moons, for the set feasts, for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.

34 And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people for the wood-offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law; 35 And to bring the first-fruits of our ground and the first-fruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, to the house of the LORD; 36 Also the first-born of our sons and of our livestock, as it is written in the law, and the first-born of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God to the priests who minister in the house of our God; 37 And that we should bring the first-fruits of our dough and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine, and of oil to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground to the Levites, so that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage. 38 And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites take tithes. And the Levites shall bring up the tenth of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers of the treasure house. 39 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the chambers where the vessels of the sanctuary are, as well as the priests who minister, the gatekeepers, and the singers. And we will not forsake the house of our God.

_The rulers, voluntary men, and the tenth man chosen by lot dwell at Jerusalem, 1, 2. A catalog of their names, 3-19. The remnant dwell in other cities, 20-36._

1 And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem. The rest of the people also cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities. 2 And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.

3 Now these are the chief of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem. But in the cities of Judah everyone dwelt in his possession in their cities, namely, Israel, the priests, the Levites, the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants. 4 And some of the children of Judah and some of the children of Benjamin dwelt at Jerusalem. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children of Perez; 5 And Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni. 6 All the sons of Perez who dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred and sixty-eight valiant men.

7 And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jesaiah; 8 And after him, Gabbai and Sallai, nine hundred and twenty-eight. 9 And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer. And Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city.

10 Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin; 11 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler of the house of God. 12 And their brothers who performed the work of the house numbered eight hundred and twenty-two; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchiah, 13 And his brothers, chief of the fathers, two hundred and forty-two; and Amashai the son of Azareel, the son of Ahasai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, 14 And their brothers, mighty men of valor, one hundred twenty-eight. And their overseer was Zabdiel the son of one of the great men.

15 Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 16 And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God; 17 And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah the second among his brothers; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 18 All the Levites in the holy city numbered two hundred and eighty-four.

19 Moreover, the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers who kept the gates numbered one hundred and seventy-two.

20 And the rest of Israel, the priests, and the Levites were in all the cities of Judah, each in his inheritance. 21 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel. And Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims.

22 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God. 23 For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day. 24 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people.

25 And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjath-arba and in its villages, at Dibon and in its villages, at Jekabzeel and in its villages, 26 At Jeshua, at Moladah, at Beth-phelet, 27 At Hazar-shual, at Beer-sheba and in its villages, 28 At Ziklag, at Mekonah and in its villages, 29 At En-rimmon, at Zareah, at Jarmuth, 30 Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish and its fields, and at Azekah and in its villages. And they dwelt from Beer-sheba to the valley of Hinnom. 31 The children of Benjamin also dwelt from Geba, at Michmash, Aija, and Beth-el, and in their villages, 32 And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. 36 And some divisions of the Levites in Judah were joined to Benjamin.

1 Now these are the priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 3 Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 4 Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah, 5 Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 6 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, 7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the chief of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua.

8 Moreover, the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah who was over the thanksgiving—he and his brothers. 9 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, were over against them in the watches. 10 And Jeshua begot Joiakim, Joiakim also begot Eliashib, Eliashib begot Joiada, 11 Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua.

12 And in the days of Joiakim these were the priests, the chief of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; 13 Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 14 Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 15 Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 16 Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 17 Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; 18 Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 19 Of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 20 Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 21 Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.

22 As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the chiefs of the fathers were recorded, and also the priests in the reign of Darius the Persian. 23 The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. 24 And the chief of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers over against them, to praise and to give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward. 25 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates. 26 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest and scribe.

27 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites out of all their places to bring them to Jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness, with thanksgivings, with singing, and with cymbals, psalteries, and harps. 28 And the sons of the singers assembled, both out of the plain country around Jerusalem and from the villages of Netophathi, 29 Also from the house of Gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem. 30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and then they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.

31 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall and appointed two great companies of those who gave thanks, of which one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung-gate. 32 And after them went Hoshaiah and half of the princes of Judah, 33 And Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 35 And some of the priests' sons with trumpets, namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph; 36 And his brothers, Shemaiah, Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them. 37 And at the fountain-gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David at the ascent of the wall above the house of David, even to the water-gate eastward.

38 And the other company of those who gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall, 39 And from above the gate of Ephraim, above the old gate, above the fish-gate, the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep-gate. And they stood still in the prison-gate. 40 So the two companies of those who gave thanks stood in the house of God, and I and the half of the rulers with me; 41 And the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; 42 And Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud with Jezrahiah their overseer. 43 Also that day, they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy. The wives and the children also rejoiced. Thus the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.

44 And at that time some were appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites, for Judah rejoiced over the priests and over the Levites who served. 45 And both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the ward of their God and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David and of Solomon his son. 46 For in the days of David and Asaph of old, there were chiefs for the singers and for songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 47 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, every day his portion. And they sanctified holy things to the Levites, and the Levites sanctified them to the children of Aaron.

And therein was found written that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God forever, 2 Because they did not meet the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Baalam against them so that he would curse them—but our God turned the curse into a blessing. 3 Now it came to pass when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.

4 And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied to Tobiah. 5 And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where they formerly laid the food-offerings, the frankincense, the vessels, the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the offerings of the priests. 6 But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem. For in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came to the king, and after some days I obtained leave of the king. 7 And I came to Jerusalem and discerned the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah in preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. 8 And it grieved me greatly; therefore, I cast all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. 9 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers. And I brought there again the vessels of the house of God, with the food-offering and the frankincense.

10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them, for the Levites and the singers who did the work had each fled to his field. 11 Then I contended with the rulers, and said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" Then I assembled them and set them in their place. 12 Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries. 13 And I made treasurers over the treasuries: Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah, and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, for they were accounted faithful. Their office was to distribute to their brothers. 14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for its offices.

15 In those days I saw in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, bringing in sheaves, and lading donkeys, and also wine, grapes, figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. And I testified against them on the day they sold provisions. 16 Also, men of Tyre dwelt therein who brought fish and all manner of wares and sold on the sabbath to the children of Judah, even in Jerusalem. 17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, "What evil thing is this that you do, profaning the sabbath day? 18 Did your fathers not do so, and did our God not bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? Yet you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath."

19 And it came to pass, that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened until after the sabbath. And I set some of my servants at the gates, so that there should be no burden brought in on the sabbath day. 20 And the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice. 21 Then I testified against them, and said to them, "Why do you lodge in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you." From that time forth they no longer came on the sabbath. 22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your mercy.

23 In those days I also saw Jews who had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab. 24 And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people. 25 And I contended with them, cursed them, smote some of them, plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons or for yourselves. 26 Did Solomon king of Israel not sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him who was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, foreign women even caused him to sin. 27 Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil and transgress against our God in marrying foreign wives?" 28 And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore, I chased him away from me. 29 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.

30 Thus I cleansed them from all strangers and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, each in his business, 31 And for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
