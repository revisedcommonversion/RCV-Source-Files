[#fpe001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_Peter blesses God for his manifold spiritual graces, 1-9; showing that salvation in Christ is an object of deepest interest to the prophets and to angels, 10-12; and exhorts them accordingly to a godly way of life, since they are now born anew by the word of God, 13-25._

1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.

3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his abundant mercy, has begotten us again to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 6 In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a season (if need be) you are in heaviness through manifold temptations, 7 So that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though tried with fire, might result in praise, honor, and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. 8 Though you have not seen him, you love him, in whom, though now you do not see him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory, 9 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.

10 Concerning this salvation, the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you, 11 Searching for what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them signified when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow. 12 To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they ministered the things which are now reported to you by those who have preached the gospel to you through the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven—which things the angels desire to look into.

13 Therefore, gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ, 14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance. 15 But as he who has called you is holy, so you be holy in all manner of deportment, [[fpe001-016]]16 Because it is written, "_Be holy, for I am holy._"

17 And if you call on the Father, who, without respect of persons, judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear, 18 For you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain course of life received by tradition from your fathers, 19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. 20 He truly was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last times for you, 21 Who, by him, believe in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.

22 Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently, 23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God which lives and abides forever. [[fpe001-024]]24 For,

This is the word which was the gospel preached to you.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_Peter dissuades them from the breach of charity, 1-3; showing that Christ is the foundation upon which they are built, 4-10. He implores them also to abstain from fleshly lusts, 11, 12; to be obedient to magistrates, 13-17; and teaches servants how to obey their masters, 18, 19; patiently suffering for well doing after the example of Christ, 20-25._

1 Therefore, laying aside all malice, all guile, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil-speakings, 2 As new-born babies, desire the pure milk of the word so that you may grow thereby, [[fpe002-003]]3 If indeed you have "_tasted that the Lord is gracious._"

4 And coming to him as to a living stone, disallowed indeed by men, but chosen by God, and precious, 5 You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. [[fpe002-006]]6 Therefore, it is also contained in the Scripture,

even to those who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which they were also appointed.

[[fpe002-009]]9 But you are "_a chosen generation,_" "_a royal priesthood, a holy nation,_" "_a peculiar people, so that you should show forth the praises_" of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, 10 Who, in time past, were not a people, but are now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

11 Dearly beloved, I implore you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul, [[fpe002-012]]12 Having your manner of life honest among the Gentiles, so that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God "_on the day of visitation._"

13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as supreme, 14 Or to governors as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do well. 15 For this is the will of God: that with well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, 16 Even as free men, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. 17 Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.

18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the unfair. 19 For this is thank-worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endures grief, suffering wrongfully. 20 For what glory is it if, when you are buffeted for your sins, you bear it patiently? But if you do good and suffer for it and you bear it patiently, this is acceptable with God.

21 For even to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example so that you should follow his steps. [[fpe002-022]]22 He committed no sin, "_neither was guile found in his mouth._" 23 He, when he was reviled, did not revile in return. When he suffered, he did not threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously. [[fpe002-024]]24 He himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree so that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness. "_By his stripes you were healed._" 25 For you were as sheep going astray, but are now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Peter teaches the duty of wives and husbands to each other, 1-7; exhorting all men to unity and love, 8-13; and to suffer persecution, 14-18. He declares also the benefits of Christ toward the old world, 19-22._

1 Likewise, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands so that if any do not obey the word, they also may, without the word, be won by the deportment of the wives 2 While they behold your chaste manner of life coupled with fear. 3 Do not let your adorning be that which is outward—of braiding the hair, of wearing gold, or of putting on apparel— 4 But let it be the hidden person of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. 5 For after this manner in former times the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands, [[fpe003-006]]6 Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You are her daughters as long as you do well and are "_not afraid of sudden fear._"

7 Likewise, husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife as to the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life, so that your prayers are not hindered.

8 Finally, all of you be of one mind, compassionate, loving as brothers, tender-hearted, and courteous, 9 Not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing, but on the contrary, blessing, knowing that you are called to this, so that you should inherit a blessing. [[fpe003-010]]10 For,

|[[fpe003-011]]11 _Let him shun evil and do good._ [.linebr]#/# +
_Let him seek peace and pursue it._

_and his ears are open to their prayers._ [.linebr]#/# +
_The face of the Lord is against those who do evil._"
|===

13 And who is he who will harm you if you are followers of that which is good? [[fpe003-014]]14 But if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you. "_And do not be afraid of their terror, neither be troubled,_" [[fpe003-015]]15 But "_sanctify the Lord_" God in your hearts. Always be ready to give an answer to every man who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, but with meekness and fear. 16 Have a good conscience so that, whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good deportment in Christ. 17 For it is better, if it is the will of God, that you suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing. 18 For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, so that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit, 19 By which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison, 20 Who formerly were disobedient when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing, in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water. 21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, also now saves you (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22 Who has gone into heaven and is on the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers being made subject to him.

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_Peter exhorts them to cease from sin by the example of Christ and the consideration of the general end that now approaches, 1-11; and comforts them against persecution, 12-19._

1 Therefore, since Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind. For he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, 2 So that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. 3 For the past time is sufficient to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, having walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries, 4 In which they think it strange that you do not run with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you. 5 They shall give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 6 For this cause the gospel was also preached to those who are dead so that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.

7 But the end of all things is at hand; therefore, be sober and watch for the purpose of prayer. 8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity will cover a multitude of sins. 9 Be hospitable to one another without grudging. 10 As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same to one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 11 If any man speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God. If any man ministers, let him do it as of the ability which God gives so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

12 Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you. 13 But rejoice, seeing you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, so that when his glory is revealed you may also be glad with exceeding joy. 14 If you are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, as a thief, as an evildoer, or as a busy-body in other men's matters. 16 Yet if any man suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter. 17 For the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God. And if it first begins at us, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_Peter exhorts the elders to feed their flocks, 1-4; the younger to obey, 5-7; and all to be sober, watchful, and constant in the faith, 8; and to resist the cruel adversary the devil, 9-14._

1 I exhort the elders who are among you as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight of it—not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but from a ready mind; 3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock. 4 And when the chief Shepherd appears, you shall receive a crown of glory that does not fade away. [[fpe005-005]]5 Likewise, you younger ones, submit yourselves to the elder. Indeed, all of you be subject to one another and be clothed with humility, for "_God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble._"

6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so that he may exalt you in due time, [[fpe005-007]]7 "_Casting all your care upon him,_" for he cares for you. 8 Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil walks around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. 9 Resist him steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers who are in the world. 10 But the God of all grace who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, shall himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you. 11 To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

12 By Silvanus our faithful brother, as I account him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand. 13 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you, and so does Mark my son. 14 Greet one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
