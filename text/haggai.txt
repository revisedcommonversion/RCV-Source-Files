== The Word of the Lord to Haggai

*Haggai | Ἀγγαῖος | חגי*

[#hag001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_The time when Haggai prophesied, 1. He reproves the people for neglecting the building of the house, 2-6. He incites them to the building, 7-11. He encourages them to set about the work, and on their doing so, promises that God will be with them, 12-15._

1 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying, 2 "Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, 'This people says, "The time has not come, the time that the LORD'S house should be built."'" 3 Then the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying, 4 "Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses and this house lie waste?" 5 Now therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: "Consider your ways. 6 You have sown much and bring in little. You eat, but you do not have enough. You drink, but you are not filled with drink. You clothe yourselves, but there is no one warm. And he who earns wages, earns wages to put it into a bag with holes."

7 Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Consider your ways. 8 Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house. Then I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified," says the LORD. 9 "You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew upon it. Why?" says the LORD of hosts. "Because of my house that lies waste, and each of you runs to his own house. 10 Therefore, for your sake the heavens withhold the dew and the earth withholds her fruit. 11 And I called for a drought upon the land, upon the mountains, upon the grain, upon the new wine, upon the oil, upon that which the ground brings forth, upon men, upon livestock, and upon all the labor of the hands."

12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people feared before the LORD. 13 Then Haggai the LORD'S messenger spoke the LORD'S message to the people, saying, "'I am with you,' says the LORD." 14 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people, and they came and performed work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, 15 On the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_He encourages the people to the work, by promise of greater glory to the second temple than was in the first, 1-9. In the type of holy things and unclean he shows their sins hindered the work, 10-19. God's promise to Zerubbabel, 20-23._

1 In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai, saying, 2 "Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 3 'Who is left among you who saw this house in her first glory? And how do you see it now? Is it not in your eyes as nothing in comparison? 4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel,' says the LORD. 'Be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,' says the LORD. 'Work, for I am with you,' says the LORD of hosts. 5 'According to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, so my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.' [[hag002-006]]6 For thus says the LORD of hosts: 'Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land, 7 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come. And I will fill this house with glory,' says the LORD of hosts. 8 'The silver is mine and the gold is mine,' says the LORD of hosts. 9 'The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former,' says the LORD of hosts. 'And in this place I will give peace,' says the LORD of hosts."

10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying, 11 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'Ask the priests concerning the law, saying, 12 "If someone bears holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touches bread, pottage, wine, oil, or any food, shall it be holy?"'" And the priests answered and said, "No." 13 Then Haggai said, "If someone who is unclean by a dead body touches any of these, shall it be unclean?" And the priests answered and said, "It shall be unclean." 14 Then Haggai answered, and said, "'So is this people and so is this nation before me,' says the LORD, 'and so is every work of their hands. And that which they offer there is unclean. 15 And now, I pray you, consider from this day onward, before stone was laid upon stone in the temple of the LORD. 16 Since those days were, when someone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten. When someone came to the press-vat to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty. 17 I smote you with blight, with mildew, and with hail in all the labors of your hands, yet you did not turn to me,' says the LORD. 18 'Consider now from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD'S temple was laid, consider it. 19 Is the seed yet in the barn? Indeed, the vine, the fig-tree, the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not brought forth. From this day I will bless you.'"

20 And again the word of the LORD came to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying, 21 "Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, 'I will shake the heavens and the earth. 22 I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen. I will overthrow the chariots and those who ride in them, and the horses and their riders shall come down, each by the sword of his brother. 23 In that day,' says the LORD of hosts, 'I will take you, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,' says the LORD, 'and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,' says the LORD of hosts."
