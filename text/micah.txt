== The Word of the Lord to Micah

*Micah | Μιχαίας | מיכה*

[#mic001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_The time when Micah prophesied, 1. He shows the wrath of God against Jacob for idolatry, 2-9. He exhorts to mourning, 10-16._

1 [_The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem._]

2 Hear, all you people. [.linebr]#/# +
Listen, O earth and all who are therein. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the Lord GOD be witness against you, [.linebr]#/# +
the Lord from his holy temple.

3 For behold, the LORD comes forth from his place, [.linebr]#/# +
and will come down and tread [.linebr]#/# +
upon the high places of the earth.

4 And the mountains shall be melted under him, [.linebr]#/# +
and the valleys shall be split, [.linebr]#/# +
as wax before the fire [.linebr]#/# +
and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.

5 "All this is for the transgression of Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
and for the sins of the house of Israel. [.linebr]#/# +
What is the transgression of Jacob? [.linebr]#/# +
Is it not Samaria? [.linebr]#/# +
And what are the high places of Judah? [.linebr]#/# +
Are they not Jerusalem?

6 Therefore, I will make Samaria as a heap of the field [.linebr]#/# +
and as plantings of a vineyard. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will pour down her stones into the valley [.linebr]#/# +
and lay her foundations bare.

7 And all her engraved images shall be beaten to pieces, [.linebr]#/# +
all her wages shall be burned with the fire, [.linebr]#/# +
and all her idols I will lay desolate, [.linebr]#/# +
for she gathered it from the payment of a harlot, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall return to the payment of a harlot."

8 Therefore, I will wail and howl. [.linebr]#/# +
I will go stripped and naked. [.linebr]#/# +
I will make a wailing like the jackals [.linebr]#/# +
and mourning as the owls.

9 For her wound is incurable, [.linebr]#/# +
and it has come to Judah. [.linebr]#/# +
He has come to the gate of my people, [.linebr]#/# +
even to Jerusalem.

10 Do not declare it at Gath. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not weep at all. [.linebr]#/# +
In the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust.

11 Pass on, you inhabitant of Saphir, [.linebr]#/# +
having your shame exposed. [.linebr]#/# +
The inhabitant of Zaanan did not come forth [.linebr]#/# +
in the mourning of Beth-ezel. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall receive from you his standing.

12 For the inhabitant of Maroth [.linebr]#/# +
waited anxiously for good, [.linebr]#/# +
but evil came down from the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
to the gate of Jerusalem.

13 O inhabitant of Lachish, [.linebr]#/# +
bind the chariot to the swift beast. [.linebr]#/# +
She is the beginning of the sin [.linebr]#/# +
to the daughter of Zion, [.linebr]#/# +
for the transgressions of Israel [.linebr]#/# +
were found in you.

14 Therefore, you shall give presents [.linebr]#/# +
to Moresheth-gath. [.linebr]#/# +
The houses of Achzib shall be a lie [.linebr]#/# +
to the kings of Israel.

15 Yet I will bring an heir to you, [.linebr]#/# +
O inhabitant of Mareshah. [.linebr]#/# +
The glory of Israel shall come to Adullam.

16 Make yourself bald and shave yourself [.linebr]#/# +
for the children of your delight. [.linebr]#/# +
Enlarge your baldness as the eagle, [.linebr]#/# +
for they have gone into captivity from you.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_Against oppression, 1-3. A lamentation, 4-6. A reproof of injustice and idolatry, 7-11. A promise of restoring Jacob, 12, 13._

1 Woe to those who devise iniquity [.linebr]#/# +
and work evil upon their beds! [.linebr]#/# +
When the morning is light, they practice it, [.linebr]#/# +
because it is in the power of their hand.

2 And they covet fields and take them by violence, [.linebr]#/# +
and also houses, and take them away. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus they oppress a man and his house, [.linebr]#/# +
even a man and his heritage.

3 Therefore, thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold, against this family I devise an evil, [.linebr]#/# +
from which you shall not remove your necks, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall you go haughtily, for this time is evil.

4 In that day one shall take up a parable against you [.linebr]#/# +
and lament with a grievous lamentation, and say, [.linebr]#/# +
'We are utterly wasted. [.linebr]#/# +
He has changed the portion of my people. [.linebr]#/# +
How he has removed it from me! [.linebr]#/# +
To the rebellious he has divided our fields.'

5 Therefore, you shall have no one [.linebr]#/# +
who shall cast the line by lot [.linebr]#/# +
in the congregation of the LORD.

6 'Do not prophesy,' they say to those who prophesy. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall not prophesy to them. [.linebr]#/# +
Reproaches shall not depart.

7 Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
'Is the Spirit of the LORD shortened? [.linebr]#/# +
Are these his doings?' [.linebr]#/# +
Do my words not do good [.linebr]#/# +
to him who walks uprightly?

8 Even of late my people have risen up [.linebr]#/# +
as an enemy. [.linebr]#/# +
You pull off the robe with the garment [.linebr]#/# +
from those who pass by securely [.linebr]#/# +
as men averse to war.

9 The women of my people you have cast out [.linebr]#/# +
from their pleasant houses. [.linebr]#/# +
From their children [.linebr]#/# +
you have taken away my glory forever.

10 Arise, and depart, for this is not your rest. [.linebr]#/# +
Because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, [.linebr]#/# +
even with a grievous destruction.

11 If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
'I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink,' [.linebr]#/# +
he shall even be the prophet of this people.

12 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of you. [.linebr]#/# +
I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. [.linebr]#/# +
I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, [.linebr]#/# +
as the flock in the midst of their fold. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall make great noise [.linebr]#/# +
by reason of the multitude of men.

13 The breaker has come up before them. [.linebr]#/# +
They have broken up and have passed through the gate [.linebr]#/# +
and gone out by it. [.linebr]#/# +
And their king shall pass before them, [.linebr]#/# +
and the LORD at their head."

[#mic003%breakable]
=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_The cruelty of the princes, 1-4. The falsehood of the prophets, 5-7. The ill-grounded security of them both, 8-12._

1 And I said, [.linebr]#/# +
"Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
and you princes of the house of Israel. [.linebr]#/# +
Is it not for you to know judgment?

2 You hate the good and love the evil. [.linebr]#/# +
You pluck off their skin from them [.linebr]#/# +
and their flesh from off their bones.

3 You also eat the flesh of my people [.linebr]#/# +
and flay their skin from off them. [.linebr]#/# +
You break their bones [.linebr]#/# +
and chop them in pieces, [.linebr]#/# +
as that which is for the pot, [.linebr]#/# +
and as flesh within the cauldron.

4 Then you shall cry to the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
but he will not hear you. [.linebr]#/# +
He will even hide his face from you at that time, [.linebr]#/# +
as you have been ill behaved in your doings."

5 Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets [.linebr]#/# +
who deceive my people, [.linebr]#/# +
who bite with their teeth, [.linebr]#/# +
and cry, "Peace," [.linebr]#/# +
and he who puts nothing into their mouths, [.linebr]#/# +
they even prepare war against him:

6 "Therefore, night shall be for you [.linebr]#/# +
so that you shall not have a vision. [.linebr]#/# +
And it shall be dark for you [.linebr]#/# +
so that you shall not divine. [.linebr]#/# +
And the sun shall go down over the prophets, [.linebr]#/# +
and the day shall be dark over them.

7 Then the seers shall be ashamed [.linebr]#/# +
and the diviners confounded. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, they shall all cover their lips, [.linebr]#/# +
for there is no answer from God."

8 But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and of judgment and of might, [.linebr]#/# +
to declare to Jacob his transgression [.linebr]#/# +
and to Israel his sin.

9 Hear this, I pray you, you heads of the house of Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
and princes of the house of Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
who abhor judgment and pervert all equity.

10 They build up Zion with blood [.linebr]#/# +
and Jerusalem with iniquity.

11 Her heads judge for bribes, [.linebr]#/# +
her priests teach for payment, [.linebr]#/# +
and her prophets divine for money. [.linebr]#/# +
Yet they will lean upon the LORD and say, [.linebr]#/# +
"Is the LORD not among us? [.linebr]#/# +
No evil can come upon us."

12 Therefore, Zion for your sake [.linebr]#/# +
shall be plowed as a field, [.linebr]#/# +
Jerusalem shall become heaps, [.linebr]#/# +
and the mountain of the house [.linebr]#/# +
as the high places of the forest.

[#mic004%breakable]
=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_The glory, 1, 2, and the peace of Christ's kingdom, 5. The restoration, 6-10, and victory of the church, 11-13._

1 But in the last days it shall come to pass, [.linebr]#/# +
that the mountain of the house of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
shall be established on the top of the mountains, [.linebr]#/# +
and it shall be exalted above the hills, [.linebr]#/# +
and people shall flow to it.

2 And many nations shall come and say, [.linebr]#/# +
"Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and to the house of the God of Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
and he will teach us of his ways, [.linebr]#/# +
and we will walk in his paths." [.linebr]#/# +
For the law shall go forth from Zion [.linebr]#/# +
and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

3 And he shall judge among many people [.linebr]#/# +
and rebuke strong nations afar off. [.linebr]#/# +
And they shall beat their swords into plow-shares [.linebr]#/# +
and their spears into pruning-hooks. [.linebr]#/# +
Nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall they learn war anymore.

4 But they shall each sit under his vine [.linebr]#/# +
and under his fig-tree, [.linebr]#/# +
and no one shall make them afraid. [.linebr]#/# +
For the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken it.

5 For all people will each walk in the name of his god, [.linebr]#/# +
and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God [.linebr]#/# +
forever and ever.

6 "In that day," says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"I will assemble her who is lame. [.linebr]#/# +
I will gather her who is driven out [.linebr]#/# +
and her whom I have afflicted.

7 I will make her who was lame a remnant [.linebr]#/# +
and her who was cast far off a strong nation. [.linebr]#/# +
And the LORD will reign over them on mount Zion [.linebr]#/# +
from now on, even forever."

8 And you, O tower of the flock, [.linebr]#/# +
the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, [.linebr]#/# +
it shall come to you, [.linebr]#/# +
even the former dominion shall come, [.linebr]#/# +
the kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.

9 Now why do you cry aloud? [.linebr]#/# +
Is there no king in you? [.linebr]#/# +
Has your counselor perished? [.linebr]#/# +
For pangs have taken you as a woman in travail.

10 Be in pain and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, [.linebr]#/# +
like a woman in travail. [.linebr]#/# +
For now you shall go forth from the city [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall dwell in the field, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall go even to Babylon. [.linebr]#/# +
There you shall be delivered. [.linebr]#/# +
There the LORD shall redeem you [.linebr]#/# +
from the hand of your enemies.

11 Now also many nations are gathered against you, [.linebr]#/# +
who say, "Let her be defiled, [.linebr]#/# +
and let our eye look upon Zion."

12 But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
neither do they understand his counsel, [.linebr]#/# +
for he will gather them as sheaves into the floor.

13 "Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, [.linebr]#/# +
for I will make your horn iron [.linebr]#/# +
and I will make your hooves brass. [.linebr]#/# +
And you shall beat many people in pieces. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will consecrate their gain to YAHWEH [.linebr]#/# +
and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth."

[#mic005%breakable]
=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_The birth of Christ, 1-3. His kingdom, 4-7. His conquest, 8-15._

1 Now gather yourself in troops, [.linebr]#/# +
O daughter of troops. [.linebr]#/# +
He has laid siege against us. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall smite the judge of Israel [.linebr]#/# +
with a rod upon the cheek.

[[mic005-002]]2 "But you, Beth-lehem Ephratah, [.linebr]#/# +
though you are little among the thousands of Judah, [.linebr]#/# +
yet out of you he shall come forth to me [.linebr]#/# +
who is to be ruler in Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
whose goings forth have been from of old, [.linebr]#/# +
from everlasting."

3 Therefore, he will give them up [.linebr]#/# +
until the time that she who travails has brought forth. [.linebr]#/# +
Then the remnant of his brothers shall return [.linebr]#/# +
to the children of Israel.

4 And he will stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. [.linebr]#/# +
And they shall abide, for now he will be great [.linebr]#/# +
to the ends of the earth.

5 And this one will be peace. [.linebr]#/# +
When the Assyrian comes into our land [.linebr]#/# +
and treads in our palaces, [.linebr]#/# +
we shall raise against him seven shepherds [.linebr]#/# +
and eight principal men.

6 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword [.linebr]#/# +
and the land of Nimrod in its entrances. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus he will deliver us from the Assyrian [.linebr]#/# +
when he comes into our land [.linebr]#/# +
and treads within our borders.

7 And the remnant of Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
shall be in the midst of many people [.linebr]#/# +
as a dew from the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
as the showers upon the grass, [.linebr]#/# +
which do not wait for man, [.linebr]#/# +
nor delay for the sons of men.

8 And the remnant of Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
shall be among the Gentiles [.linebr]#/# +
in the midst of many people [.linebr]#/# +
as a lion among the beasts of the forest, [.linebr]#/# +
as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, [.linebr]#/# +
who, if he goes through, [.linebr]#/# +
both treads down and tears in pieces, [.linebr]#/# +
and no one can deliver.

9 Your hand shall be lifted up upon your adversaries, [.linebr]#/# +
and all your enemies shall be cut off.

10 "And it shall come to pass in that day," says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"that I will cut off your horses out of the midst of you [.linebr]#/# +
and destroy your chariots.

11 And I will cut off the cities of your land [.linebr]#/# +
and throw down all your strongholds.

12 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of your hand, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall have no more soothsayers.

13 Your engraved images I will also cut off, [.linebr]#/# +
and your standing images out of the midst of you, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall no longer worship the work of your hands.

14 And I will pluck up your groves out of the midst of you. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus I will destroy your cities.

15 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury [.linebr]#/# +
upon the heathen who have not heard."

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_God's controversy for ingratitude, 1-5; for ignorance, 6-9, for injustice, 10-15; and for idolatry, 16._

1 Hear now what the LORD says. [.linebr]#/# +
"Arise, contend before the mountains [.linebr]#/# +
and let the hills hear your voice.

2 Hear, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, [.linebr]#/# +
and you strong foundations of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD has a controversy with his people [.linebr]#/# +
and he will plead with Israel.

3 O my people, what have I done to you? [.linebr]#/# +
And how have I wearied you? [.linebr]#/# +
Testify against me.

4 For I brought you out of the land of Egypt [.linebr]#/# +
and redeemed you from the house of servants, [.linebr]#/# +
and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

5 O my people, remember now [.linebr]#/# +
what Balak king of Moab consulted, [.linebr]#/# +
and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, [.linebr]#/# +
[and what I did] from Shittim to Gilgal, [.linebr]#/# +
so that you may know the righteousness of the LORD."

6 How shall I come before the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and bow myself before the high God? [.linebr]#/# +
Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, [.linebr]#/# +
with calves of a year old?

7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, [.linebr]#/# +
or with tens of thousands of rivers of oil? [.linebr]#/# +
Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, [.linebr]#/# +
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

8 He has shown you, O man, what is good. [.linebr]#/# +
And what does the LORD require of you, [.linebr]#/# +
but to do justly, to love mercy, [.linebr]#/# +
and to walk humbly with your God?

9 The LORD'S voice cries to the city— [.linebr]#/# +
and wisdom shall fear your name, [.linebr]#/# +
"Hear the rod and who has appointed it.

10 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness [.linebr]#/# +
in the house of the ungodly, [.linebr]#/# +
and the scant measure that is abominable?

11 Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances [.linebr]#/# +
and with the bag of deceitful weights?

12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence [.linebr]#/# +
and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, [.linebr]#/# +
and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.

13 Therefore, I have also made you to grieve in smiting you. [.linebr]#/# +
I have made you desolate because of your sins.

14 You shall eat, but not be satisfied, [.linebr]#/# +
and your emptiness shall be in the midst of you. [.linebr]#/# +
And you shall take hold, [.linebr]#/# +
but shall not preserve. [.linebr]#/# +
And that which you preserve [.linebr]#/# +
I will give up to the sword.

15 You shall sow, but you shall not reap. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall tread the olives, [.linebr]#/# +
but you shall not anoint yourself with oil. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall make sweet wine, [.linebr]#/# +
but shall not drink wine.

16 For the statutes of Omri [.linebr]#/# +
and all the works of the house of Ahab are kept, [.linebr]#/# +
and you walk in their counsels. [.linebr]#/# +
Therefore, I will make you a desolation [.linebr]#/# +
and the inhabitants thereof a hissing, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall bear the reproach of my people."

[#mic007%breakable]
=== Chapter 7

[.outline.text-center]
_The church, bewailing her small number, 1, 2, and the general corruption, 3, 4, puts her confidence not in man, but in God, 5-7. She triumphs over her enemies, 8-13. She prays to God, 14. God comforts her by promises of confusion to her enemies, 15-17, and by his mercies, 18-20._

1 Woe is me! [.linebr]#/# +
For I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, [.linebr]#/# +
as the grape-gleanings of the vintage. [.linebr]#/# +
There is no cluster to eat. [.linebr]#/# +
My soul desired the first ripe fruit.

2 The godly man has perished from the earth [.linebr]#/# +
and there is no one upright among men. [.linebr]#/# +
They all lie in wait for blood. [.linebr]#/# +
They each hunt his brother with a net.

3 Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it thoroughly. [.linebr]#/# +
The prince and also the judge ask for a reward. [.linebr]#/# +
And the great man, he utters the evil desire of his soul. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus they weave it together.

4 The best of them is as a brier. [.linebr]#/# +
The most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge. [.linebr]#/# +
The day of your watchmen and your visitation comes. [.linebr]#/# +
Now shall be their perplexity.

5 Do not trust in a friend. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not put confidence in a guide. [.linebr]#/# +
Keep the doors of your mouth [.linebr]#/# +
from her who lies in your bosom.

[[mic007-006]]6 For the son dishonors the father, [.linebr]#/# +
the daughter rises up against her mother, [.linebr]#/# +
the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. [.linebr]#/# +
A man's enemies are the men of his own house.

7 Therefore, I will look to the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
I will wait for the God of my salvation. [.linebr]#/# +
My God will hear me.

8 Do not rejoice against me, O my enemy. [.linebr]#/# +
When I fall, I shall arise. [.linebr]#/# +
When I sit in darkness, [.linebr]#/# +
the LORD will be a light to me.

9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
because I have sinned against him, [.linebr]#/# +
until he pleads my cause [.linebr]#/# +
and executes judgment for me. [.linebr]#/# +
He will bring me forth to the light, [.linebr]#/# +
and I shall behold his righteousness.

10 Then she who is my enemy shall see it, [.linebr]#/# +
and shame shall cover her who said to me, [.linebr]#/# +
"Where is the LORD your God?" [.linebr]#/# +
My eyes shall behold her. [.linebr]#/# +
Now she shall be trodden down [.linebr]#/# +
as the mire of the streets.

11 In the day that your walls are to be built, [.linebr]#/# +
in that day the decree shall be far removed.

12 In that day they shall also come even to you [.linebr]#/# +
from Assyria and from the fortified cities [.linebr]#/# +
and from the fortress even to the river, [.linebr]#/# +
from sea to sea [.linebr]#/# +
and from mountain to mountain.

13 But the land shall be desolate [.linebr]#/# +
because of those who dwell in it, [.linebr]#/# +
for the fruit of their doings.

14 Feed your people with your rod, [.linebr]#/# +
the flock of your heritage, [.linebr]#/# +
who dwell solitarily in the forest, [.linebr]#/# +
in the midst of Carmel. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, [.linebr]#/# +
as in the days of old.

15 "According to the days of your departure [.linebr]#/# +
from the land of Egypt [.linebr]#/# +
I will show to them marvelous things."

16 The nations shall see and be confounded [.linebr]#/# +
at all their might. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall lay their hand upon their mouth. [.linebr]#/# +
Their ears shall be deaf.

17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall move out of their holes [.linebr]#/# +
like worms of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall be afraid of the LORD our God [.linebr]#/# +
and shall fear because of you.

18 Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity [.linebr]#/# +
and passes by the transgression [.linebr]#/# +
of the remnant of his heritage? [.linebr]#/# +
He does not retain his anger forever [.linebr]#/# +
because he delights in mercy.

19 He will return. He will have compassion upon us. [.linebr]#/# +
He will tread our iniquities under foot. [.linebr]#/# +
And you will cast all their sins [.linebr]#/# +
into the depths of the sea.

20 You will give the truth to Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
and the mercy to Abraham, [.linebr]#/# +
which you have sworn to our fathers [.linebr]#/# +
from the days of old.
