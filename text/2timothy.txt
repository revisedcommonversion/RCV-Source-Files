== Paul's Second Letter to Timothy

*2nd Timothy | Προς Τιμόθεον Β'*

[#sti001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul's love for Timothy, and the unfeigned faith which was in Timothy himself, his mother, and grandmother, 1-5. He is exhorted to stir up the gift of God which was in him, 6, 7; to be steadfast and patient in persecution, 8-12; and to persist in the form and truth of that doctrine which he had learned from him, 13, 14. Phygellus and Hermogenes and such as those are noted, and Onesiphorus is highly commended, 15-18._

1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,

2 To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day, 4 Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, so that I may be filled with joy, 5 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that is in you also. 6 For this cause I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God which is in you by the imposition of my hands. 7 For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.

8 Do not be therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but be partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God. 9 He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began, 10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. 11 For this, I am appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 12 For this cause, I also suffer these things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him for that day. 13 Hold firm to the form of sound words, which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 14 Keep that good thing which was committed to you by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us.

15 This you know, that all those who are in Asia are turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 16 May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my bonds. 17 But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me. 18 May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that day. And in all that he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_Timothy is exhorted again to constancy and perseverance, and to do the duty of a faithful servant of the Lord in dividing the word rightly and avoiding profane and vain babblings, 1-16. Of Hymeneus and Philetus, 17, 18. The foundation of the Lord is sure, 19-21. He is taught of what to beware, what to follow after, and in what manner the servant of the Lord ought to behave himself, 22-26._

1 You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 2 And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. 3 Therefore, endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 4 No man who wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life so that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier. 5 And if a man also strives for masteries, yet he is not crowned unless he strives lawfully. 6 The farmer who labors must be first partaker of the fruits. 7 Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.

8 Remember that Jesus Christ of the offspring of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel. 9 For this I suffer trouble as an evil-doer, even to bonds, but the word of God is not bound. 10 Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the elect so that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 11 This is a faithful saying:

14 Put others in remembrance of these things, charging them before the Lord that they do not contend about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. 15 Give diligence to show yourself approved to God, a workman who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 16 But shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. 17 And their word will spread like gangrene, of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus, 18 Who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is past already, and they overthrow the faith of some. [[sti002-019]]19 Nevertheless, the foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: "_The Lord knows those who are his,_" and, "Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity."

20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth. Some are for honor and some for dishonor. 21 If a man therefore will cleanse himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and profitable for the master's use, and prepared for every good work. 22 Flee also youthful lusts, but follow righteousness, faith, charity, and peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 23 But avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they engender contentions. 24 And the servant of the Lord must not contend, but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient, 25 In meekness instructing those who oppose themselves, if God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, 26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul notifies Timothy of the times to come, 1-5; describes the enemies of the truth, 6-9; propounds to him his own example, 10-15; and commends the holy Scriptures, 16, 17._

1 Know this also, that in the last days perilous times will come. 2 For men will be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 Without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, lacking self-control, fierce, despisers of those who are good, 4 Traitors, headstrong, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, 5 Having a form of godliness, but denying its power. Turn away from such. 6 For of this sort are those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with diverse lusts, 7 Ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth—men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith. 9 But they shall proceed no further, for their folly will be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.

10 But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, patience, charity, endurance, 11 Persecutions, and afflictions which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra. I endured such persecutions, and out of them all the Lord delivered me. 12 And indeed all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 13 But evil men and seducers will become worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 14 But continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, 15 And that from a child you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, 17 So that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly furnished to all good works.

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul exhorts Timothy to do his duty with all care and diligence, 1-5; certifies him of the nearness of his death, 6-8; desires him to come speedily to him and to bring Mark with him and certain things which he wrote for, 9-13; warns him to beware of Alexander the smith, 14, 15; informs him what had happened to him at his first answering, 16-18; and soon after he concludes the letter, 19-22._

1 I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom, 2 Preach the word, be instant in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and doctrine. 3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts they will multiply for themselves teachers, having itching ears, 4 And they will turn away their ears from the truth and will be turned to fables. 5 But watch in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, and make full proof of your ministry.

6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. 7 I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. 8 From now on, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me at that day, and not to me only, but to all those also who love his appearing.

9 Do your diligence to come to me shortly. 10 For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is profitable to me for the ministry. 12 And I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 13 The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when you come, bring it with you, and also the books, but especially the parchments. 14 Alexander the copper-smith did me much evil—may the Lord reward him according to his works— 15 Of whom you also must be aware, for he has greatly withstood our words.

16 At my first defense no man stood with me, but all men forsook me. I pray to God that it may not be laid to their charge. 17 But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me so that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 18 And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

19 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 20 Erastus stayed at Corinth, but Trophimus I have left sick at Miletum. 21 Do your diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and also Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.

22 May the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
