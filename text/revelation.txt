== The Revelation of the Apostle John

*Revelation | Αποκάλυψις Ιωάνου*

[#rev001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_The preface, 1-3. John's salutation to the seven churches of Asia, 4-6. The coming of Christ, 7. His glorious power and majesty, 8-20._

1 This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John, 2 Who bore testimony of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw. 3 Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand.

4 John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace and peace be to you from him who is, who was, and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne, 5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first-begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him who loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood 6 And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. [[rev001-007]]7 Behold, he "_comes with the clouds,_" and every eye shall see him, even those who pierced him. And all kindreds of the earth "_shall wail because of him._" Even so, Amen.

8 "[.woc]#I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,#" says the Lord, "[.woc]#who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.#"

9 I, John, who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos because of the word of God and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ. 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice like a trumpet, 11 Saying, "[.woc]#I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last,#" and, "[.woc]#What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.#"

12 And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks, 13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks someone like the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot and girded around the chest with a golden girdle. 14 His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow, his eyes were as a flame of fire, 15 His feet like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the sound of many waters. 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars. And out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword. And his countenance was as the sun shining in its strength.

17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as if dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying to me, "[.woc]#Do not fear. I am the first and the last,# 18 [.woc]#And the living one. And I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. I have the keys of hell and of death.# 19 [.woc]#Write, therefore, the things which you have seen, the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.# 20 [.woc]#The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden candlesticks is this: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.#"

_What is commanded to be written to the angels, that is, the ministers of the churches of Ephesus, 1-7, Smyrna, 8-11, Pergamos, 12-17, Thyatira, 18-29; and what is commended or found lacking in them._

1 "[.woc]#To the angel of the church of Ephesus, write: 'He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, says these things:#

2 "[.woc]#'"I know your works, your labor, and your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you have tried those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them liars.# 3 [.woc]#You have patience and have endured for my name's sake, and have not grown weary.# 4 [.woc]#Nevertheless, I have this against you: that you have left your first love.# 5 [.woc]#Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works. Otherwise, I will come to you quickly and will remove your candlestick out of its place unless you repent.# 6 [.woc]#But this you have: that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.# 7 [.woc]#He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."'#

8 "[.woc]#And to the angel of the church in Smyrna, write: 'The first and the last, who was dead and is alive, says these things:#

9 "[.woc]#'"I know your works, tribulation, and poverty (but you are rich), and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.# 10 [.woc]#Fear none of those things which you shall suffer. Behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison so that you may be tried. And you shall have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you a crown of life.# 11 [.woc]#He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death."'#

12 "[.woc]#And to the angel of the church in Pergamos, write: 'He who has the sharp sword with two edges says these things:#

13 "[.woc]#'"I know your works and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is. And you hold firmly to my name and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you where Satan dwells.# 14 [.woc]#But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit lewdness.# 15 [.woc]#Likewise, you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.# 16 [.woc]#Repent, or else I will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.# 17 [.woc]#He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give to eat from the hidden manna and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no man knows, except he who receives it."'#

18 "[.woc]#And to the angel of the church in Thyatira, write: 'The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass, says these things:#

19 "[.woc]#'"I know your works, charity, service, faith, your patience, and your works—and the last works to be more than the first.# 20 [.woc]#But, I have a few things against you, because you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to commit lewdness and to eat things sacrificed to idols.# 21 [.woc]#And I gave her time to repent of her lewdness and she did not repent.# 22 [.woc]#Behold, I will cast her into a bed and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of their deeds.# 23 [.woc]#And I will kill her children with death. And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts. And I will give to each of you according to your works.# 24 [.woc]#But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will put upon you no other burden.# 25 [.woc]#But that which you already have, hold firmly until I come.# [[rev002-026]]26 [.woc]#And he who overcomes and keeps my works to the end, '_to him I will give power over the nations,_# [[rev002-027]]27 [.woc]#_And he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and as the vessels of a potter they shall be broken to pieces,_' even as I received from my Father.# 28 [.woc]#And I will give him the morning-star.# 29 [.woc]#He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."'#"

_The angel of the church of Sardis is reproved, 1, 2; exhorted to repent, and threatened if he does not repent, 3-6. The angel of the church of Philadelphia, 7-9, is approved for his diligence and patience, 10-13; the angel of Laodicea rebuked for being neither hot nor cold, 14-18, and admonished to be more zealous, 19. Christ stands at the door and knocks, 20-22._

1 "[.woc]#And to the angel of the church in Sardis, write: 'He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars says these things: "I know your works. You have a reputation of being alive, and yet you are dead.# 2 [.woc]#Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die, for I have not found your works fulfilled before God.# 3 [.woc]#Remember therefore how you have received and heard. Keep it, and repent.

And I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.# 6 [.woc]#He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."'#

7 "[.woc]#And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia, write: 'He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, and he who opens and no man shuts, and shuts and no man opens, says these things:#

Hold firmly to that which you have so that no man takes your crown.# 12 [.woc]#He who overcomes, I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more. And I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God. And I will write upon him my new name.# 13 [.woc]#He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."'#

14 "[.woc]#And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans, write: 'The Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God, says these things:#

15 "[.woc]#'"I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot.# 16 [.woc]#So then, because you are luke-warm and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth.# 17 [.woc]#Because you say, 'I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing,' and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked,# 18 [.woc]#I counsel you to buy from me gold tried in the fire so that you may be rich, and white clothing so that you may be clothed and the shame of your nakedness may not appear, and anoint your eyes with eye-salve so that you may see.# 19 [.woc]#As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous therefore, and repent.# 20 [.woc]#Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with me.# 21 [.woc]#To him who overcomes, I will grant to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne.# 22 [.woc]#He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."'#"

[.outline.text-center]
_John sees the throne of God in heaven, 1-3. The twenty-four elders, 4, 5. The four living beings full of eyes in front and behind, 6-9. The elders lay down their crowns and worship him who sat on the throne, 10, 11._

1 After this, I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up here and I will show you things which must be hereafter." 2 And immediately I was in the Spirit. And behold, a throne was set in heaven, and someone sat on the throne. 3 And he who sat was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius stone. And there was a rainbow around the throne in sight like an emerald. 4 And around the throne were twenty-four seats, and upon the seats I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white clothing, and they had on their heads crowns of gold.

5 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 6 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like crystal. And in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living beings full of eyes in front and behind. 7 And the first living being was like a lion, the second living being like a calf, the third living being had a face like a man, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle. [[rev004-008]]8 And the four living beings, each of them had six wings around him and they were full of eyes within. And they do not rest day or night, saying, "'_Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,_' who was, and is, and is to come." 9 And when those living beings give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sat on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 10 The twenty-four elders fall down before him who sat on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. And they cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 11 "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, honor, and power, for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they exist and were created."

[.outline.text-center]
_The book sealed with seven seals, 1-8, which only the Lamb who was slain is worthy to open, 9-11. Therefore, the elders praise him and confess that he redeemed them with his blood, 12-14._

1 And I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals. 2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?" 3 And no man in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look upon it. 4 And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book or to look upon it. 5 And one of the elders says to me, "Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book and to break its seven seals."

6 And I beheld, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living beings and in the midst of the elders stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. 7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him who sat upon the throne. 8 And when he had taken the book, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each of them having harps and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints. 9 And they sang a new song, saying, "You are worthy to take the book and to open its seals, for you were slain and have redeemed us for God by your blood out of every kindred, language, people, and nation, 10 And have made us kings and priests to our God. And we shall reign on the earth."

11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living beings, and the elders. And their number was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, 12 Saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing." 13 And every creature which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, and those which are in the sea, and all which are in them, I heard saying, "Blessing, honor, glory, and power be to him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb forever and ever." 14 And the four living beings said, "Amen." And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped him who lives forever and ever.

_The opening of the first six of the seven seals in order, and what followed afterward, 1-17._

1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, like the noise of thunder, one of the four living beings saying, "Come and see." 2 And I saw, and behold, a white horse. And he who sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given to him. And he went forth conquering and to conquer.

3 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living being say, "Come and see." 4 And there went out another horse that was red. And power was given to him who sat upon him to take peace from the earth so that they should kill one another. And there was given to him a great sword.

5 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living being say, "Come and see." And I beheld, and behold, a black horse. And he who sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. 6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living beings say, "A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius, and see that you do not hurt the oil and the wine."

7 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, "Come and see." 8 And I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And his name who sat on him was Death, and hell followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and with the beasts of the earth.

9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" 11 And white robes were given to every one of them. And it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer until their fellow-servants and also their brothers, who should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.

12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood. 13 And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig-tree casts its untimely figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind. 14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place. 15 And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the chief captains, the mighty men, every slave, and every free man hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, 16 And said to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb. 17 For the great day of his wrath has come, and who will be able to stand?"

_An angel seals the servants of God in their foreheads, 3. The number of those who were sealed: of the tribes of Israel a certain number, 4-8. Of all other nations an innumerable multitude, which stand before the throne, clad in white robes and with palm branches in their hands, 9-13. Their robes were washed in the blood of the Lamb, 14-17._

1 And after these things, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth so that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. 2 And I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 3 Saying, "Do not hurt the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads."

4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed. And there were sealed one hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.

5 Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand were sealed. 6 Of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand were sealed. 7 Of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand were sealed. 8 Of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed.

9 After this, I beheld, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number of all nations, kindreds, people, and languages, stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes and with palm branches in their hands. 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb." 11 And all the angels stood around the throne, the elders, and the four living beings. And they fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped God, 12 Saying, "Amen. Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might be to our God forever and ever. Amen."

13 And one of the elders answered, saying to me, "Who are these who are arrayed in white robes? And where did they come from?" 14 And I said to him, "Sir, you know." And he said to me, "These are those who came out of the great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 15 Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple. And he who sits on the throne will dwell among them. [[rev007-016]]16 '_They shall no longer hunger, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun fall upon them, nor any heat._' 17 For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will feed them and will lead them to living fountains of waters. And God will wipe away all tears from their eyes."

[.outline.text-center]
_At the opening of the seventh seal, 1, seven angels have seven trumpets given to them, 2-5. Four of them sound their trumpets, and great plagues follow, 6-8. Another angel puts incense to the prayers of the saints on the golden altar, 9-13._

1 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. 2 And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

3 And another angel having a golden censer came and stood at the altar. And much incense was given to him so that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. 4 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God out of the angel's hand. 5 And the angel took the censer, filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth. And there were voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.

6 And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.

7 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth. And the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.

8 And the second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea. And the third part of the sea became blood. 9 And the third part of the creatures having life which were in the sea died. And the third part of the ships were destroyed.

10 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning like a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters. 11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many men died by the waters because they were made bitter.

12 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, along with the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened. And the day did not shine for a third part of it, and the night likewise.

13 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are about to sound!"

_At the sounding of the fifth angel, a star falls from heaven, to whom is given the key of the bottomless pit, 1. He opens the pit, and there come forth locusts like scorpions, 2-11. The first woe past, 12. The sixth trumpet sounds, 13. Four angels who were bound are let loose. 14-21._

1 And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth. And the key of the bottomless pit was given to him. 2 And he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. 3 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 4 And it was said to them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God in their foreheads. 5 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months. And their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when he strikes a man. 6 And in those days men shall seek death and shall not find it. And they shall desire to die, but death shall flee from them.

7 And the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle. And on their heads were something like crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men. 8 And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions. 9 And they had breast-plates like breast-plates of iron. And the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. 10 And they had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. And their power was to hurt men five months. 11 And they had a king over them, who is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon, but in the Greek language he has his name: Apollyon.

12 One woe is past, and behold, there are still two more woes coming hereafter.

13 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, 14 Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound in the great Euphrates River." 15 And the four angels were released who were prepared for that hour, day, month, and year to slay the third part of men. 16 And the number of the army of the horsemen was two hundred million. And I heard their number. 17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision and those who sat on them, having breast-plates of fire, of jacinth, and brimstone. And the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths issued fire, smoke, and brimstone. 18 By these three the third part of men was killed: by the fire, by the smoke, and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths. 19 For their power is in their mouth and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm.

20 And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and of wood, which neither can see, hear, nor walk. 21 They did not repent of their murders, of their sorceries, of their lewdness, nor of their thefts.

1 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head. His face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire. 2 And he had in his hand a little book opened. And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth, 3 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. 4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and do not write them." 5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven [[rev010-006]]6 And swore by him who lives forever and ever, who "_created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things which are in it,_" that there should be time no longer. 7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.

8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, "Go, and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stands upon the sea and upon the earth." 9 And I went to the angel and said to him, "Give me the little book." And he said to me, "Take it and eat it. It shall make your belly bitter, but it shall be in your mouth sweet as honey." 10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it. And it was in my mouth sweet as honey, but as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. 11 And he said to me, "You must prophesy again before many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."

_The two witnesses prophesy, 1-5. They have power to shut heaven so that it may not rain, 6. The beast shall fight against them and kill them, 7. They lie unburied, 8-10; and after three and a half days rise again, 11-13. The second woe is past, 14. The seventh trumpet sounds, 15-19._

1 And there was given to me a reed like a rod. And the angel stood, saying, "Rise, and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship in it. 2 But leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not measure it, for it is given to the Gentiles. And they shall tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months. 3 And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth." 4 These are the two olive-trees and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. 5 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. 6 These have power to shut heaven so that it may not rain in the days of their prophecy, and they have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they desire.

7 And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them. 8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. 9 And those of the people, kindreds, languages, and nations shall see their dead bodies for three and a half days and shall not allow their dead bodies to be put in graves. 10 And those who dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwelt on the earth.

11 And after three and a half days, the Spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those who saw them. 12 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them. 13 And the same hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell. And seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake. And the remnant were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.

14 The second woe is past, and behold, the third woe comes quickly.

15 And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever." 16 And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their seats fell upon their faces and worshiped God, 17 Saying, "We give you thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who is, was, and is to come, because you have taken your great power and have reigned. 18 And the nations were angry, but your wrath has come. And the time has come that the dead should be judged and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, to the saints, and to those who fear your name, small and great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."

19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament. And there were lightnings, voices, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail.

_A woman clothed with the sun travails, 1-3. The great red dragon stands before her, ready to devour her child, 4, 5; after she delivers her child, she flees into the wilderness, 6. Michael and his angels fight with the dragon and prevail, 7-12. The dragon, being cast down to the earth, persecutes the woman, 13-17._

1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. 2 And she was with child and she cried out, travailing in birth and in pain to deliver.

3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven, and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads. 4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to deliver to devour her child as soon as it was born.

[[rev012-005]]5 And she brought forth a male child, who was to "_rule all nations with a rod of iron._" And her child was caught up to God and to his throne. 6 And the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by God so that they should feed her there for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.

7 And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought 8 And did not prevail, neither was their place found anymore in heaven. 9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the Devil and Satan, which deceives the whole world. He was cast out upon the earth and his angels were cast out with him. 10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, "Now salvation, strength, the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ have come. For the accuser of our brothers is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night. 11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony. And they did not love their lives even to death. 12 Therefore, rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea! For the devil has come down to you having great wrath because he knows that he has only a short time."

13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the male child. 14 And two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman so that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place where she is nourished for a time, times, and half a time from the face of the serpent. 15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman so that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood. 16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. 17 And the dragon was angry with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

_A beast rises out of the sea with seven heads, ten horns, and ten crowns, 1. His description, power, blasphemy, cruelty, etc., 2-10. Another beast comes out of the earth with two horns, deceiving the world by his false miracles and causing everyone to receive his mark, 11-18._

1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. 2 And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like the feet of a bear and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power, his seat, and great authority. 3 And I saw one of his heads as if it were wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world wondered after the beast. 4 And they worshiped the dragon which gave power to the beast. And they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?" 5 And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and power was given to him to continue forty-two months. 6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name, his tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.

7 And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And power was given to him over all kindreds, languages, and nations. 8 And all who dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. 9 If any man has an ear, let him hear. 10 He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity. He who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon. 12 And he exercises all the power of the first beast before him and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 13 And he does great wonders, even making fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. 14 He deceives those who dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast, saying to those who dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which was wounded by the sword and lived. 15 And he had power to give life to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 16 And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads 17 So that no man might buy or sell, except him who had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. And his number is six hundred and sixty-six.

_The Lamb standing on mount Zion with his company, 1-5. An angel preaches the gospel, 6, 7. The fall of Babylon, 8-14. The harvest of the world, 15-19. The wine-press of the wrath of God, 20._

1 And I looked, and behold, a Lamb stood on mount Zion, and with him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having his Father's name written on their foreheads. 2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters and like the voice of a great thunder. And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps. 3 And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders. And no man could learn that song but the one hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. 4 These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from among men, being the first-fruits to God and to the Lamb. 5 And in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without fault before the throne of God.

6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth and to every nation, kindred, language, and people, 7 Saying with a loud voice, "Fear God and give glory to him, because the hour of his judgment has come. And worship him who made heaven, earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters."

[[rev014-008]]8 And there followed another angel, saying, "'_Fallen, fallen is Babylon_' that great city, who made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her lewdness."

9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If any man worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 11 And the smoke of their torment ascends up forever and ever. And they have no rest day or night who worship the beast and his image and whoever receives the mark of his name. 12 Here is the patience of the saints. Here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."

13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'" "Truly," says the Spirit, "in that they shall rest from their labors, for their works follow with them."

14 And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and someone like the Son of man sat upon the cloud having a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, "Thrust in your sickle and reap, for the time has come for you to reap, because the harvest of the earth is ripe." 16 And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.

17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 18 And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe." 19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God. 20 And the wine-press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the wine-press, even to the horses' bridles, by the space of one thousand and six hundred furlongs.

2 And I saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire. And those who had gained the victory over the beast, over his image, over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.

_The angels pour out their vials full of wrath, 1-5. The plagues that follow, 6-14. Christ comes as a thief. Blessed are those who watch, 15-21._

1 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, "Go, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth."

2 And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth. And there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men who had the mark of the beast and upon those who worshiped his image.

3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea, and it became like the blood of a dead man. And every living soul died in the sea.

4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters, and they became blood. 5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, "You are righteous, O Lord, who is and who was, because you have judged these things. 6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink, for they are worthy." 7 And I heard another from the altar say, "Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments."

8 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun, and power was given to it to scorch men with fire. 9 And men were scorched with great heat and they blasphemed the name of God, who has power over these plagues. And they did not repent to give him glory.

10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast, and his kingdom was full of darkness. And they gnawed their tongues because of the pain 11 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores. And they did not repent of their deeds.

12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great Euphrates River, and its water was dried up so that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.

13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14 For they are the spirits of demons that work miracles, which go forth to the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. 15 "[.woc]#Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.#" 16 And he gathered them into a place called in the Hebrew language, Armageddon.

17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air. And there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne, saying, "It is done." 18 And there were voices, thunders, and lightnings, and there was a great earthquake such as has not been since men were upon the earth—so mighty an earthquake, and so great. 19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. 20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. 21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent.

1 And one of the seven angels who had the seven vials came and talked with me, saying to me, "Come here. I will show to you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon many waters, 2 With whom the kings of the earth have committed lewd deeds and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her lewdness." 3 So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet-colored beast that was full of names of blasphemy and had seven heads and ten horns. 4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet-color and decked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her lewdness. 5 And upon her forehead was a name written, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH." 6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with great wonder.

7 And the angel said to me, "Why did you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her which has the seven heads and ten horns. 8 The beast that you saw, it was and is no more. And it shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition. And those who dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, is no more, and yet is. 9 And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits. 10 And there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come—but when he comes, he must remain a short time. 11 And the beast that was and is no more, he is also an eighth, and belongs to the seven and goes into perdition. 12 And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but receive power as kings for one hour with the beast. 13 These have one mind and shall give their power and strength to the beast. 14 These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings. And those who are with him are the called, chosen, and faithful."

15 And he says to me, "The waters which you saw where the harlot sits are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages. 16 And the ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the harlot, shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire. 17 For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will and to come to one mind and give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled. 18 And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth."

1 And after these things, I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory. [[rev018-002]]2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, "'_Fallen, fallen is Babylon_' the great, and she has become the habitation of demons, the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hateful bird. 3 For all nations have drank of the wine of the wrath of her lewdness, the kings of the earth have committed lewd deeds with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the abundance of her delicacies."

4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her, my people, so that you are not partakers of her sins and that you do not receive any of her plagues. 5 For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. 6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double to her double according to her works. In the cup which she has filled, fill to her double. [[rev018-007]]7 However much she has glorified herself and lived deliciously, in such amount give her torment and sorrow, for she says in her heart, '"_I sit as a queen,_" "_I am not a widow, and never shall I see sorrow._"' 8 Therefore, her plagues shall come in one day: death, mourning, and famine. And she shall be utterly burned with fire, for the Lord God who judges her is strong.

9 "And the kings of the earth who have committed lewdness and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they see the smoke of her burning, 10 Standing afar off because of the fear of her torment, saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come.'

11 "And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her because no man buys their merchandise anymore: 12 The merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, of pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all thyine wood, all vessels of ivory, all vessels of most precious wood, of brass, iron, marble, 13 Cinnamon, odors, ointments, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, beasts, sheep, horses, chariots, slaves, and souls of men. 14 And the fruits that your soul lusted after have departed from you, and all things which were dainty and splendid have departed from you, and you shall no longer find them at all. 15 The merchants of these things who were made rich by her shall stand afar off because of the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, 16 And saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city that was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, precious stones, and pearls! 17 For in one hour such great wealth has come to nothing.' And every ship-master and all the company in ships, along with sailors and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, 18 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What city is like this great city?' 19 And they cast dust on their heads and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city in which all who had ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her opulence!' For in one hour she has been made desolate. 20 Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her."

21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, "Thus with violence that great city Babylon shall be thrown down and shall no longer be found. 22 And the voice of harpers, musicians, of pipers, and trumpeters shall no longer be heard in you. No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore. The sound of a millstone shall no longer be heard in you. 23 The light of a candle shall no longer shine in you. The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall no longer be heard in you. For your merchants were the great men of the earth, because by your sorceries all nations were deceived. 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, of saints, and of all who were slain upon the earth."

1 And after these things, I heard a great voice of many people in heaven, saying, "Alleluia. Salvation, glory, honor, and power to the Lord our God.

7 "Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready. 8 And it was granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white"—for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.

And he said to me, "Behold, do not do that. I am a fellow-servant with you and with your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."

11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And he who sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. 12 His eyes were like a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written that no man knew, but he himself. 13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood.

And he "_shall rule them with a rod of iron._" And he treads the wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. 16 And he has on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, "KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS."

17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, "Come, and assemble yourselves to the supper of the great God 18 So that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great."

19 And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies assembled to make war against him who sat on the horse and against his army.

20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These were both cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. 21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him who sat upon the horse, which sword proceeds out of his mouth. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.

[.outline.text-center]
_Satan shall be bound for a thousand years, 1-5. The first resurrection; those who have part therein are blessed, 6. Satan shall be let loose again, 7. Gog and Magog, 8, 9. The devils shall be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, 10, 11. The last and general resurrection, 12-15._

1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 2 And he laid hold upon the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, bound him a thousand years, 3 Cast him into the bottomless pit, shut him up, and set a seal upon him so that he should no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years should be fulfilled. And after that, he must be released a little season.

4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast nor his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. 5 But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. 6 Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. On such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years.

7 And when the thousand years have expired, Satan shall be released from his prison, 8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them to battle—the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. 9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth and encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. 10 And the devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.

11 And I saw a great white throne and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was no place found for them. 12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. And the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works. 13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them. And they were each judged according to their works. 14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. 15 And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

=== Chapter 21

[.outline.text-center]
_A new heaven and a new earth, 1-9. The heavenly Jerusalem, with a full description thereof, 10-22. She needs no sun, the glory of God being her light, 23. The kings of the earth bring their riches to her, 24-27._

1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no more sea. 2 And I, John, saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men. He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, because the former things have passed away."

5 And he who sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." And he said to me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful." 6 And he said to me, "It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give to him who is thirsty from the fountain of the water of life. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things. And I will be his God, and he shall be my son. [[rev021-008]]8 But the fearful, unbelieving, the abominable, murderers, lewd men, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone. This is the second death."

9 And there came to me one of the seven angels who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife."

10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, 11 Having the glory of God. And her light was like a stone most precious, even like a jasper-stone, clear as crystal. 12 It had a great and high wall and had twelve gates with names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel, and at the gates twelve angels. 13 On the east were three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. 14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15 And he who talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 16 And the city lies square, and the length is as large as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, its breadth, and its height are equal. 17 And he measured its wall: one hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, which is also of an angel. 18 And the building of its wall was of jasper. And the city was pure gold, like clear glass. 19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; 20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprase; the eleventh, a jacinth; and the twelfth, an amethyst. 21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls. Every single gate was made of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.

22 And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 23 And the city had no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God enlightened it, and the Lamb is its light. 24 And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light. And the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it. 25 And its gates shall not be shut by day, for there shall be no night there. 26 And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it. 27 And there shall in no way enter into it anything that defiles, neither whatever works abomination or makes a lie, but those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.

=== Chapter 22

[.outline.text-center]
_The river of the water of life, 1. The tree of life, 2-4. The light of the city of God is himself, 5-8. The angel will not be worshiped, 9-17. Nothing may be added to the word of God, nor taken from it, 18-21._

1 And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb 2 In the midst of its street. And on each side of the river was the tree of life, which bore twelve kinds of fruits and yielded her fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 3 And there shall be no more curse. But the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him. 4 And they shall see his face, and his name shall be in their foreheads. 5 And there shall be no night there. They need no candle, neither light of the sun, because the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.

6 And he said to me, "These sayings are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done."

7 "[.woc]#Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.#"

8 And I, John, saw these things and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things. 9 Then he says to me, "Behold, do not do that, for I am a fellow-servant with you, with your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the sayings of this book. Worship God."

10 And he says to me, "Do not seal the sayings of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand. 11 He who is unjust, let him be unjust still. He who is filthy, let him be filthy still. He who is righteous, let him be righteous still. He who is holy, let him be holy still."

12 "[.woc]#And behold, I come quickly. And my reward is with me to give to every man according as his work shall be.# 13 [.woc]#I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.#

14 "[.woc]#Blessed are those who do his commandments so that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city.# 15 [.woc]#For outside are dogs, sorcerers, lewd men, murderers, idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.#

16 "[.woc]#I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright and morning-star.#"

17 And the Spirit and the bride say, "Come." And let him who hears say, "Come." And let him who is thirsty come. And whoever wishes, let him take the water of life freely.

18 For I testify to every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book. 19 And if any man takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the tree of life, out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

20 He who testifies these things says, "[.woc]#Surely I come quickly.#" Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

21 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
