== Paul's Letter to the Romans

*Romans | Προς Ῥωμαίοις*

[#rom001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul commends his calling to the Romans, 1-8; and his desire to come to them, 9-15. What his gospel is, 16, 17. God is angry with sin, 18-20. What were the sins of the Gentiles, 21-32._

1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God, 2 Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy Scriptures, 3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the offspring of David according to the flesh, 4 And declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead, 5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name, 6 Among whom you are also the called of Jesus Christ.

7 To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers, 10 Making request (if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God) to come to you. 11 For I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established, 12 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith of both you and me. 13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that I have often purposed to come to you (but have been until now hindered) so that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. 14 I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise. 15 So, as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are at Rome also.

16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. [[rom001-017]]17 For in this the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, "_The just shall live by faith._"

18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness, 19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. 20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse. 21 For when they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, neither were thankful, but they became vain in their imaginations and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23 And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, birds, four-footed beasts, and creeping animals.

24 Therefore, God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies among themselves, 25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.

26 For this cause, God gave them up to vile affections. For even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature. 27 And likewise also, the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was proper.

28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not fitting, 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 Without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful; 32 Who, knowing the judgment of God, that those who commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in those who do them.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_No excuse for sin, 1-5. No escape from judgment, 6-13. Gentiles cannot, 14-16; nor Jews, 17-29._

1 Therefore, you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are who judge. For wherein you judge another, you condemn yourself, for you who judge do the same things. 2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who commit such things. 3 And do you think this, O man, who judges those who do such things and does the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God? 4 Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? 5 But because of your hardness and impenitent heart, you treasure up for yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, [[rom002-006]]6 Who "_will render to every man according to his deeds._" 7 To those who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, honor, and immortality, he will give eternal life, 8 But to those who are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, he will give indignation and wrath. 9 There will be tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Gentile, 10 But glory, honor, and peace to every man who works good, to the Jew first and also to the Gentile, 11 For there is no respect of persons with God.

12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law— 13 For the hearers of the law are not just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified; 14 For when the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these not having the law are a law to themselves, 15 In that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing testimony and their thoughts between one another accusing, or else excusing one another— 16 On the day when God judges the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.

17 But if you are named a Jew and rest in the law and make your boast in God, 18 And know his will and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law, 19 And are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 20 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babies, who have the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law— 21 You therefore who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach a man should not steal, do you steal? [[rom002-022]]22 You who say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege? 23 You who make your boast in the law, through breaking the law, do you dishonor God? [[rom002-024]]24 For "_the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,_" as it is written.

25 For circumcision truly profits if you keep the law, but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision. 26 Therefore, if the uncircumcision keeps the righteousness of the law, shall his uncircumcision not be counted for circumcision? 27 And shall uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, not judge you who by the letter and circumcision transgress the law? 28 For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh. 29 But he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the Spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not from men, but from God.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_The Jews' prerogative, 1, 2; which they have not lost, 3-8; however the law convinces them also of sin, 9-19; therefore no flesh is justified by the law, 20-27; but all, without difference, are justified by faith only, 28-30; and yet the law is not abolished, 31._

1 What advantage then does the Jew have? Or what profit is there of circumcision? 2 Much in every way. Chiefly, because to them the oracles of God were committed. 3 For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? [[rom003-004]]4 By no means. Truly let God be true, but every man a liar, as it is written,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|"_That you may be justified in your sayings_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and may overcome when you are judged._"
|===

5 But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man.) 6 By no means. For then how shall God judge the world? 7 For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory, why yet am I also judged as a sinner? 8 Why not rather say (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), "Let us do evil so that good may come"? Their condemnation is just.

9 What then? Are we better than they are? No, in no way. For we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin, [[rom003-010]]10 As it is written,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|"_There is no one righteous, not even one._

|[[rom003-011]]11 _There is no one who understands._ [.linebr]#/# +
_There is no one who seeks God._

|[[rom003-012]]12 _They have all gone out of the way._ [.linebr]#/# +
_They have together become unprofitable._ [.linebr]#/# +
_There is no one who does good, not even one._"

"_The poison of asps is under their lips,_"

|
|[[rom003-016]]16 _Destruction and misery are in their ways._

|
|[[rom003-017]]17 _And the way of peace they have not known._"

|
|[[rom003-018]]18 "_There is no fear of God before their eyes._"
|===

[[rom003-019]]19 Now we know that whatever things the law says, it says to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God. 20 Therefore, by the deeds of the law, no flesh shall be justified in his sight, for by the law comes the knowledge of sin.

21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being testified by the law and the prophets, 22 Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and upon all those who believe, for there is no difference. [[rom003-023]]23 For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, 24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, 25 Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God, 26 To declare at this time his righteousness, so that he may be just and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus.

27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith. 28 Therefore, we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 29 Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also, 30 Seeing that it is one God who will justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith.

31 Do we then make the law void through faith? By no means. But we establish the law.

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_Abraham's faith was imputed to him for righteousness, 1-9; before he was circumcised, 10-12. By faith only he and his offspring received the promise, 13-15. Abraham is the father of all who believe, 16-23. Our faith also shall be imputed to us for righteousness, 24, 25._

1 What shall we then say that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found? 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to glory about, but not before God. [[rom004-003]]3 For what does the Scripture say? "_Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness._" 4 Now to him who works, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 5 But to him who does not work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 6 Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness without works, [[rom004-007]]7 Saying,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and whose sins are covered._

|
|[[rom004-008]]8 _Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin._"
|===

[[rom004-009]]9 Does this blessedness then come upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was "_reckoned to Abraham for righteousness._" 10 How then was it reckoned? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had while still uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are not circumcised, so that righteousness might be imputed to them also; 12 And the father of circumcision to those who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had while still uncircumcised.

13 For the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his offspring through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 14 For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect, 15 Because the law works wrath, for where there is no law, there is no transgression.

16 Therefore, it is of faith so that it might be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all the offspring, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all [[rom004-017]]17 (As it is written, "_I have made you a father of many nations_"), before him whom he believed, even God, who revives the dead and calls those things which are not as though they were, [[rom004-018]]18 Who, against hope, believed with hope that he should become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken: "_Thus shall your offspring be._" 19 And not having been weak in faith, he did not consider his own body now dead when he was about one hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. 20 He did not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, 21 And being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform. [[rom004-022]]22 And therefore, it was "_imputed to him for righteousness._" 23 Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, 24 But for us also, to whom it will be imputed, if we believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 25 Who was delivered for our offenses and raised again for our justification.

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, 1; and joy in our hope, 2-7; that since we were reconciled by his blood when we were enemies, 8, 9; we shall much more be saved, being reconciled, 10, 11. As sin and death came by Adam, 12-16; so much more righteousness and life by Jesus Christ, 17-19. Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, 20, 21._

1 Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 Through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 3 And not only this, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation works patience; 4 And patience, experience; and experience, hope. 5 And hope does not make us ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us.

6 For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For one will scarcely die for a righteous man, though perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die. 8 But God commends his love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 10 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. 11 And not only this, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

12 Therefore, as sin entered into the world by one man, and death by sin, so also death passed upon all men, for all have sinned. 13 For until the law, sin was in the world. But sin is not imputed when there is no law. 14 Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him who was to come.

15 But the free gift is not like the offense. For if through the offense of one many are dead, much more have the grace of God and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many. 16 And the gift is not as through one who sinned. For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification. 17 For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.

18 Therefore, as by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, so also by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justification of life. 19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one many shall be made righteous. 20 Moreover, the law entered so that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, 21 So that as sin has reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_We may not live in sin, 1; for we are dead to it, 2; as appears by our baptism, 3-11. Do not let sin reign anymore, 12-17; because we have yielded ourselves to the service of righteousness, 18-22; and for that, death is the wages of sin, 23._

1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may abound? 2 By no means. How shall we, who are dead to sin, live any longer therein? 3 Do you not know, that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death? 4 Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. 5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection, 6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him so that the body of sin may be destroyed, so that from now on we should not serve sin. 7 For he who is dead is freed from sin.

8 Now if we are dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, 9 Knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over him. 10 For in that he died, he died to sin once, but in that he lives, he lives to God. 11 Likewise, reckon yourselves also to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

12 Do not let sin therefore reign in your mortal body so that you obey it in its lusts. 13 Neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. 14 For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace.

15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? By no means. 16 Do you not know, that to the one you yield yourselves as slaves in obedience, you are slaves to the one you obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness? 17 But God be thanked, that though you were the slaves of sin, you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine into which you were delivered. 18 Being then made free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness. 19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members slaves to uncleanness and to iniquity to [work] iniquity, even so now yield your members slaves to righteousness, which leads to holiness.

20 For when you were the slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness. 21 What fruit did you have then in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. 22 But now being made free from sin and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit that leads to holiness, and the result is everlasting life. 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord.

=== Chapter 7

[.outline.text-center]
_No law has power over a man longer than he lives, 1-3. But we are dead to the law, 4-6. Yet the law is not sin, 7-11; but holy, just, and good, 12-15; as Paul acknowledges, who is grieved because he cannot keep it, 16-25._

1 Do you not know, brothers (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives? 2 For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives. But if the husband is dead, she is released from the law of her husband. 3 So then, if while her husband lives she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if her husband is dead, she is free from that law so that she is not an adulteress if she is married to another man.

4 Therefore, my brothers, you have also become dead to the law by the body of Christ so that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, so that we should bring forth fruit to God. 5 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death. 6 But now we are delivered from the law, having died to that by which we were held, so that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.

[[rom007-007]]7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? By no means. No, I had not known sin, but by the law. For I would not have known lust if the law had not said, "_You shall not covet._" 8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. 9 For I was alive without the law once. But when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. 10 And the commandment which was ordained to life I found to be to death. 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me and by it slew me. 12 Therefore, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, just, and good.

13 Then was that which is good made death to me? By no means. But sin, so that it might be shown to be sin, wrought death in me by that which is good, so that sin, by the commandment, might become exceedingly sinful.

14 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. 15 For that which I do, I do not allow. For what I wish to do, I do not do. But what I hate, I do. 16 If then I do that which I do not wish to do, I consent to the law that it is good. 17 Now then it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me. 18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) no good thing dwells. For desire is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I do not find. 19 For the good that I wish to do, I do not do. But the evil which I do not wish to do, I do. 20 Now if I do that which I do not wish to do, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.

21 I find then a law, that when I wish to do good, evil is present with me. 22 For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. 23 But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 24 O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? 25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then, with the mind, I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin.

=== Chapter 8

[.outline.text-center]
_Those who are in Christ are free from condemnation, 1-4. What harm comes of the flesh, 5-12; and what good of the Spirit, 13-18. The glorious deliverance all things long for, 19-28, was beforehand decreed from God, 29-37. Nothing can sever us from his love, 38, 39._

1 There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. 3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, 4 So that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. 5 For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 6 For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace, 7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. 8 So then those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

9 But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his. 10 And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 11 But if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also revive your mortal bodies by his Spirit who dwells in you.

12 Therefore, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 13 For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die, but if you, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live. 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 15 For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption by which we cry, "Abba, Father." 16 The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are the children of God, 17 And if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ—if we suffer with him, so that we may be glorified together.

18 For I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God. 20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope, 21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now. 23 And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption, namely, the redemption of our body. 24 For we were saved in hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees? 25 But if we hope for what we do not see, then with patience we wait for it.

26 Likewise, the Spirit also helps our infirmities. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 27 And he who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.

28 And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to his purpose. 29 For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son so that he might be the first-born among many brothers. 30 Moreover, those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.

31 What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things? 33 Who will lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God who justifies. 34 Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, or rather who is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, or sword? [[rom008-036]]36 As it is written,

|"_For your sake we are killed all the day long._ [.linebr]#/# +

37 But in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38 For I am persuaded that neither death, life, angels, principalities, powers, things present, things to come, 39 Height, depth, nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul is sorry for the Jews, 1-5. The promise to Abraham did not include all his descendants, 6-13. God's sovereignty, 14-24. The calling of the Gentiles and rejecting of the Jews foretold, 25-31. The cause of the Jews' stumbling, 32, 33._

1 I say the truth in Christ. I do not lie, my conscience also bearing me testimony in the Holy Spirit, 2 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. 3 For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh, 4 Who are Israelites, to whom pertain the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises, 5 Whose are the fathers, and from whom according to the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.

6 It is not as though the word of God has taken no effect. For they are not all Israel who are descendants from Israel, [[rom009-007]]7 Neither because they are the offspring of Abraham are they all children, but, "_In Isaac your offspring shall be called._" 8 That is, those who are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring. [[rom009-009]]9 For this is the word of promise: "_At this time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son._" 10 And not only this, but when Rebekah also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac 11 (For the children not yet being born, neither having done any good or evil, so that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls), [[rom009-012]]12 It was said to her, "_The elder shall serve the younger._" [[rom009-013]]13 As it is written, "_Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated._"

14 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? By no means. [[rom009-015]]15 For he says to Moses, "_I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion._" 16 So then, it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy. [[rom009-017]]17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "_Even for this same purpose I have raised you up so that I might show my power in you and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth._" 18 Therefore, he has mercy on whom he wills to have mercy, and whom he wills he hardens.

19 You will say then to me, "Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?" 20 But rather, O man, who are you who replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, "Why have you made me this way?" 21 Does the potter not have power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor? 22 What if God, willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, 23 So that he might make known the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy which he had before prepared for glory, 24 Even us whom he has called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? [[rom009-025]]25 As he also says in Hosea,

=== Chapter 10

[.outline.text-center]
_The Scripture shows the difference between the righteousness of the law and that of faith, 1-10; and that all who believe, both Jew and Gentile, shall not be confounded, 11-17; and that the Gentiles shall receive the word and believe, 18. Israel was not ignorant of these things, 19-21._

1 Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved. 2 For I bear them testimony that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 3 For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.

[[rom010-005]]5 For Moses describes the righteousness which is by the law: "_The man who does these things shall live by them._" [[rom010-006]]6 But the righteousness which is by faith speaks in this way: "Do not say in your heart, '_Who shall ascend into heaven?_' (that is, to bring Christ down), [[rom010-007]]7 Or, '_Who shall descend into the deep?_' (that is, to bring Christ back from the dead)." [[rom010-008]]8 But what does it say? "_The word is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart,_" that is, the word of faith which we preach: [[rom010-009]]9 That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved. 10 For with the heart man believes to righteousness and with the mouth confession is made to salvation. [[rom010-011]]11 For the Scripture says, "_Whoever believes in him shall not be ashamed._" 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek. For the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon him, [[rom010-013]]13 For "_whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved._"

14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? [[rom010-015]]15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "_How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things!_"

[[rom010-016]]16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, "_Lord, who has believed our report?_" 17 So then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

[[rom010-018]]18 But I say, "Have they not heard?" Yes truly,

=== Chapter 11

[.outline.text-center]
_God has not cast off all Israel, 1-6. Some were elected, though the rest were hardened, 7-15. There is hope of their conversion, 16, 17. The Gentiles may not boast over them, 18-25; for there is a promise of their salvation, 26-32. God's judgments are unsearchable, 33-36._

1 I say then, has God cast away his people? By no means. For I also am an Israelite, of the offspring of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. [[rom011-002]]2 "_God has not cast away his people_" which he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he makes intercession to God against Israel? [[rom011-003]]3 "_Lord, they have killed your prophets and dug down your altars. I am left alone. And they seek my life._" [[rom011-004]]4 But what is the answer from God to him? "_I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal._" 5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 6 And if it is by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise, grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, then it is no longer grace; otherwise, work is no longer work.

7 What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for, but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were blinded. [[rom011-008]]8 According as it is written,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

_and bow down their back always._"
|===

11 I say then, have they stumbled so that they should fall? By no means. But rather through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. 12 Now if their fall is the riches of the world and their diminishing is the riches of the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness be? 13 For I speak to you Gentiles. Since I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office, 14 If by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them. 15 For if their rejection is the reconciling of the world, what shall their receiving be, but life from the dead? 16 For if the first fruit is holy, the lump is also holy, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.

17 And if some of the branches are broken off, and you, being a wild olive-tree, are implanted among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive-tree, 18 Do not boast against the branches. But if you boast, [remember]: you do not bear the root, but the root bears you. 19 You will say then, "The branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in." 20 Right. Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be high-minded, but fear. 21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, take heed lest he also not spare you. 22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity, but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness. Otherwise, you also shall be cut off. 23 And they also, if they do not still abide in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 24 For if you were cut out of the olive-tree which is wild by nature and were grafted in contrary to nature into a good olive-tree, how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive-tree?

25 For I do not wish, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery (lest you should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. [[rom011-026]]26 And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written,

|"_The Deliverer will come out of Zion,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob._

|
|[[rom011-027]]27 _And this is my covenant to them,_" [.linebr]#/# +
"_when I take away their sins._"
|===

28 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sake, but as concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake. 29 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. 30 For as you in times past have not believed God, but have now obtained mercy through their unbelief, 31 Even so these have also now not believed so that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. 32 For God has enclosed them all in unbelief so that he might have mercy upon all.

33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments are and his ways past finding out!

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|[[rom011-034]]34 For "_who has known the mind of the Lord?_ [.linebr]#/# +
_Or who has been his counselor?_"

|[[rom011-035]]35 Or "_who has first given to him,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and it shall be recompensed to him again?_"

_God's mercies must move us to please God, 1, 2. No man must think too well of himself, 3-5; but everyone attend on that calling wherein he is placed, 6-8. Love and many other duties are required of us, 9-18. Revenge is especially forbidden, 19-21._

1 I implore you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what is that good, acceptable, and perfect will of God.

3 For through the grace given to me, I say to every man who is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith. 4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members do not have the same office, 5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and each members of one another. 6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; 7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he who teaches, on teaching; 8 Or he who exhorts, on exhortation; he who gives, let him do it with simplicity; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.

[[rom012-009]]9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil. Cleave to that which is good. 10 Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor preferring one another. 11 Do not be slothful in diligence. Be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. 12 Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, continue steadfastly in prayer. 13 Contribute to the needs of the saints and pursue hospitality.

14 Bless those who persecute you. Bless, and do not curse. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. 16 Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not mind high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Do not be wise in your own conceits. 17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. 18 If it is possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men. [[rom012-019]]19 Dearly beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath, for it is written, "_Vengeance is mine and I will repay,_" says the Lord. [[rom012-020]]20 Therefore, "_if your enemy hungers, feed him, and if he thirsts, give him drink, for in doing so you shall heap coals of fire on his head._" 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

_Subjection and many other duties we owe to the magistrates, 1-7. Love is the fulfilling of the law, 8-10. Gluttony and drunkenness, and the works of darkness, are out of season in the time of the Gospel, 11-14._

1 Let every soul be subject to the higher powers, for there is no power but from God. The powers that exist are ordained by God. 2 Whoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist shall receive for themselves condemnation. 3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good and you shall have praise from the same, 4 For he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain, for he is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him who does evil. 5 Therefore, it is necessary for you to be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake. 6 For because of this you also pay tribute, for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. 7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.

8 Owe no man anything, but to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. [[rom013-009]]9 For this, "_You shall not commit adultery,_" "_You shall not kill,_" "_You shall not steal,_" "_You shall not bear false witness,_" "_You shall not covet,_" and if there is any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, "_You shall love your neighbor as yourself._" 10 Love works no ill to one's neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law.

11 And this, knowing the time, that it is already time to awaken from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed. 12 The night is far spent and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light. 13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in lewdness and wantonness, and not in strife and envying. 14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the lusts of flesh.

_Men may not despise nor condemn one another for things indifferent, 1-12; but take heed that they give no offense in them, 13, 14; which the apostle proves unlawful by many reasons, 15-23._

1 Receive him who is weak in the faith, but not to doubtful disputations. 2 For one believes that he may eat all things, but another who is weak eats herbs. 3 Do not let him who eats despise him who does not eat, and do not let him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him. 4 Who are you who judge another man's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he shall be held up, for God is able to make him stand.

5 One man esteems one day above another, but another esteems every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. 6 He who regards the day, regards it to the Lord, and he who does not regard the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks, and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks. 7 For not one of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself. 8 For whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord. Whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. 9 For to this end Christ both died, rose, and revived, so that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living.

10 But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ. [[rom014-011]]11 For it is written,

_and every tongue shall confess to God._'"

12 So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.

13 Let us therefore not judge one another anymore. But rather judge this: that no man put a stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. 14 I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean by itself. But to him who esteems anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 15 But if your brother is grieved with your food, now you do not walk charitably. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died. 16 Therefore, do not let your good be evil spoken of, 17 For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For he who in these things serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. 19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things with which one may edify another. 20 For the sake of food, do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for that man who eats with offense. 21 It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak. 22 Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in that thing which he allows. 23 And he who doubts is condemned if he eats because he does not eat from faith, for whatever is not from faith is sin.

=== Chapter 15

[.outline.text-center]
_The strong must bear with the weak, 1. We may not please ourselves, 2; for Christ did not do so, 3-6; but receive one another, as Christ did us all, 7; both Jews and Gentiles, 8-14; Paul excuses his writing, 15-27; and promises to see them, 28, 29; and requests their prayers, 30-33._

1 We then who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves. 2 Let each of us please his neighbor for his good to edification. [[rom015-003]]3 For even Christ did not please himself, but, as it is written, "_The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me._" 4 For whatever things were written formerly were written for our learning so that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope. 5 Now may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded toward one another according to Christ Jesus, 6 So that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

7 Therefore, receive one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God. 8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promises made to the fathers, [[rom015-009]]9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written,

13 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.

14 And I myself also am persuaded concerning you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. 15 Nevertheless, brothers, I have written the more boldly to you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me from God, 16 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, so that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. 17 Therefore, I have cause for glorying through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God. 18 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not wrought by me to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, 19 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and around to Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 20 And so I have strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation, [[rom015-021]]21 But as it is written,

22 For which cause I also have been much hindered from coming to you. 23 But now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come to you, 24 Whenever I take my journey into Spain I will come to you. For I trust to see you on my journey and to be brought on my way there by you, if first I may in some measure enjoy your company. 25 But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. 26 For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who are at Jerusalem. 27 It has pleased them truly, and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things. 28 When therefore I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain. 29 And I am sure that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

30 Now I implore you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me, 31 So that I may be delivered from those in Judea who do not believe and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, 32 So that I may come to you with joy by the will of God and may be refreshed with you. 33 Now may the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

=== Chapter 16

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul desires the brothers to greet many, 1-16; and advises them to take heed of those who cause dissension and offenses, 17-20; and after various salutations ends with praise and thanks to God, 21-27._

1 I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea, 2 That you receive her in the Lord, as it is worthy for saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she has been a helper of many and of myself also.

3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus, 4 Who have for my life laid down their own necks, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. 5 Likewise, greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epenetus, who is the first-fruits of Achaia to Christ. 6 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labor on us. 7 Salute Andronicus and Junia my kinsmen and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who were also in Christ before me. 8 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord. 9 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 10 Salute Apelles, approved in Christ. Salute those who are of Aristobulus' household. 11 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet those who are of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. 12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord. 13 Salute Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers who are with them. 15 Salute Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. 16 Salute one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.

17 Now I implore you, brothers, mark those who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them. 18 For those who are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. 19 For your obedience has come abroad to all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf. But I wish you to be wise as to what is good, but innocent concerning evil. 20 And the God of peace will soon bruise Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

21 Timothy my fellow worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen salute you.

22 I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

23 Gaius, my host and also of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and also Quartus, a brother. 24 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

25 Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret since the world began, 26 But now is made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith— 27 To the only wise God be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
