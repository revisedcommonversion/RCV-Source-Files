== The Word of the Lord to Zephaniah

*Zephaniah | Σοφονίας | צפניה*

[#zph001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_The time when Zephaniah prophesied, 1. God's severe judgments against Judah, 2-18._

1 [_The word of the LORD which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah._]

|2 "I will utterly consume all things [.linebr]#/# +
from off the land,"
|===

says the LORD.

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|3 "I will consume man and beast. [.linebr]#/# +
I will consume the birds of the heaven, [.linebr]#/# +
the fish of the sea, [.linebr]#/# +
and the stumbling-blocks with the wicked. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will cut off man from off the land,"
|===

says the LORD.

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|4 "I will also stretch out my hand upon Judah [.linebr]#/# +
and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, [.linebr]#/# +
and the name of the Chemarims with the priests,

|
|5 And those who worship the host of heaven upon the house-tops, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who worship and who swear by the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and who swear by Malcham,

|
|6 And those who have turned back from the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who have not sought the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
nor inquired for him."

|
|7 Hold your peace at the presence of the Lord GOD, [.linebr]#/# +
for the day of the LORD is at hand. [.linebr]#/# +
For the LORD has prepared a sacrifice. [.linebr]#/# +
He has consecrated his guests.

|
|8 "And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice, [.linebr]#/# +
that I will punish the princes, the king's children, [.linebr]#/# +
and all those who are clothed with foreign apparel.

|
|9 In the same day I will also punish [.linebr]#/# +
all those who leap on the threshold, [.linebr]#/# +
who fill their masters' houses [.linebr]#/# +
with violence and deceit.

|
|10 And it shall come to pass in that day,"
|===

says the LORD,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish-gate, [.linebr]#/# +
a howling from the second quarter, [.linebr]#/# +
and a great crashing from the hills.

|
|11 Howl, you inhabitants of Maktesh, [.linebr]#/# +
for all the merchant people are cut down. [.linebr]#/# +
All those who bear silver are cut off.

|
|12 And it shall come to pass at that time, [.linebr]#/# +
that I will search Jerusalem with candles [.linebr]#/# +
and punish the men who are settled on their dregs, [.linebr]#/# +
who say in their heart, [.linebr]#/# +
'The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.'

|
|13 Therefore, their goods shall become plunder [.linebr]#/# +
and their houses a desolation. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall also build houses, but not inhabit them. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall plant vineyards, but not drink their wine."

|
|14 The great day of the LORD is near, [.linebr]#/# +
it is near and hastens greatly, [.linebr]#/# +
even the voice of the day of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
The mighty man shall cry there bitterly.

|
|15 That day is a day of wrath, [.linebr]#/# +
a day of trouble and distress, [.linebr]#/# +
a day of wasting and desolation, [.linebr]#/# +
a day of darkness and gloominess, [.linebr]#/# +
a day of clouds and thick darkness,

|
|16 And a day of the trumpet and alarm [.linebr]#/# +
against the fortified cities [.linebr]#/# +
and against the high towers.

|
|17 And I will bring distress upon men [.linebr]#/# +
so that they shall walk like blind men, [.linebr]#/# +
because they have sinned against the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
And their blood shall be poured out as dust [.linebr]#/# +
and their flesh as the dung.

|
|18 Neither their silver nor their gold [.linebr]#/# +
shall be able to deliver them [.linebr]#/# +
in the day of the LORD'S wrath. [.linebr]#/# +
But the whole land shall be devoured [.linebr]#/# +
by the fire of his jealousy, [.linebr]#/# +
for he will make even a sudden end [.linebr]#/# +
of all those who dwell in the land.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_An exhortation to repentance, 1-3. The judgment of the Philistines, 4-7, of Moab and Ammon, 8-11, of Ethiopia, 12, and of Assyria, 13-15._

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|1 Assemble yourselves, yes, assemble, [.linebr]#/# +
O nation not desired,

|
|2 Before the decree brings forth, [.linebr]#/# +
before the day passes as the chaff, [.linebr]#/# +
before the fierce anger of the LORD comes upon you, [.linebr]#/# +
before the day of the LORD'S anger comes upon you.

|
|3 Seek the LORD, all you meek of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
who have performed his judgment. [.linebr]#/# +
Seek righteousness. Seek meekness. [.linebr]#/# +
It may be that you will be hid [.linebr]#/# +
in the day of the LORD'S anger.

|
|4 For Gaza shall be forsaken [.linebr]#/# +
and Ashkelon a desolation. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day [.linebr]#/# +
and Ekron shall be rooted up.

|
|5 Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coasts, [.linebr]#/# +
the nation of the Cherethites! [.linebr]#/# +
The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, [.linebr]#/# +
the land of the Philistines: [.linebr]#/# +
"I will even destroy you [.linebr]#/# +
so that there shall be no inhabitant."

|
|6 And the sea coast shall be pastures, [.linebr]#/# +
with cottages for shepherds [.linebr]#/# +
and folds for flocks.

|
|7 And the coasts shall be [.linebr]#/# +
for the remnant of the house of Judah. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall feed upon them. [.linebr]#/# +
In the houses of Ashkelon [.linebr]#/# +
they shall lie down in the evening, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD their God will visit them [.linebr]#/# +
and turn away their captivity.

|
|8 "I have heard the reproach of Moab [.linebr]#/# +
and the revilings of the children of Ammon [.linebr]#/# +
by which they have reproached my people [.linebr]#/# +
and magnified themselves against their border.

|
|9 Therefore, as I live,"
|===

says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"surely Moab shall be as Sodom [.linebr]#/# +
and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, [.linebr]#/# +
even a place possessed by nettles and salt-pits [.linebr]#/# +
and a perpetual desolation. [.linebr]#/# +
The remnant of my people shall lay them waste [.linebr]#/# +
and the remainder of my people shall possess them."

|
|10 They shall have this for their pride, [.linebr]#/# +
because they have reproached and magnified themselves [.linebr]#/# +
against the people of the LORD of hosts.

|
|11 The LORD will be terrible to them, [.linebr]#/# +
for he will famish all the gods of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
And men shall worship him, each from his place, [.linebr]#/# +
even all the coastlands of the heathen.

|
|12 "You Cushites also, [.linebr]#/# +
you shall be slain by my sword."

|
|13 And he will stretch out his hand against the north [.linebr]#/# +
and destroy Assyria, [.linebr]#/# +
and will make Nineveh a desolation [.linebr]#/# +
and dry like a wilderness.

|
|14 And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, [.linebr]#/# +
all the beasts of the nations. [.linebr]#/# +
Both the cormorant and the bittern [.linebr]#/# +
shall lodge in its upper lintels. [.linebr]#/# +
Their voice shall sing in the windows. [.linebr]#/# +
Desolation shall be in the thresholds, [.linebr]#/# +
for he shall uncover the cedar work.

|
|15 This is the rejoicing city [.linebr]#/# +
that dwelt in security, [.linebr]#/# +
that said in her heart, [.linebr]#/# +
"I am, and there is no one besides me." [.linebr]#/# +
How she has become a desolation, [.linebr]#/# +
a place for beasts to lie down in! [.linebr]#/# +
Everyone who passes by her [.linebr]#/# +
shall hiss and wag his hand.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_A sharp reproof of Jerusalem for various sins, 1-7. An exhortation to wait for the restoration of Israel, 8-13, and to rejoice for their salvation by God, 14-20._

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|1 Woe to her who is filthy and polluted, [.linebr]#/# +
to the oppressing city!

|
|2 She did not obey the voice. [.linebr]#/# +
She did not receive correction. [.linebr]#/# +
She did not trust in the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
She did not draw near to her God.

|
|3 Her princes within her are roaring lions. [.linebr]#/# +
Her judges are evening wolves. [.linebr]#/# +
They do not gnaw the bones until the next day.

|
|4 Her prophets are unstable and treacherous persons. [.linebr]#/# +
Her priests have polluted what is holy. [.linebr]#/# +
They have done violence to the law.

|
|5 The just LORD is in the midst of her. [.linebr]#/# +
He will not do iniquity. [.linebr]#/# +
Every morning he brings his judgment to light. [.linebr]#/# +
He does not fail. [.linebr]#/# +
But the unjust knows no shame.

|
|6 "I have cut off the nations. [.linebr]#/# +
Their towers are desolate. [.linebr]#/# +
I made their streets waste [.linebr]#/# +
so that no one passes by. [.linebr]#/# +
Their cities are destroyed [.linebr]#/# +
so that there is no man, [.linebr]#/# +
so that there is no inhabitant.

|
|7 I said, 'Surely you will fear me and receive instruction. [.linebr]#/# +
And her dwelling place shall not be destroyed [.linebr]#/# +
on account of everything in which I have visited her.' [.linebr]#/# +
But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.

|
|8 Therefore, wait for me,"
|===

says the LORD,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"until the day that I rise up to the prey. [.linebr]#/# +
For my determination is to gather the nations, [.linebr]#/# +
so that I may assemble the kingdoms [.linebr]#/# +
to pour upon them my indignation, [.linebr]#/# +
even all my fierce anger, [.linebr]#/# +
for all the earth shall be devoured [.linebr]#/# +
with the fire of my jealousy.

|
|9 For then I will restore to the people [.linebr]#/# +
a pure language, [.linebr]#/# +
so that they may all call upon the name of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
to serve him with one consent.

|
|10 From beyond the rivers of Cush my suppliants, [.linebr]#/# +
even the daughter of my dispersed, [.linebr]#/# +
shall bring my offering.

|
|11 In that day you shall not be ashamed for all your doings [.linebr]#/# +
in which you have transgressed against me. [.linebr]#/# +
For then I will take away out of the midst of you [.linebr]#/# +
those who rejoice in your pride, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall no longer be haughty [.linebr]#/# +
because of my holy mountain.

|
|12 I will also leave in the midst of you [.linebr]#/# +
an afflicted and poor people, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.

|
|13 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, [.linebr]#/# +
nor speak lies, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, [.linebr]#/# +
for they shall feed and lie down, [.linebr]#/# +
and no one shall make them afraid."

|
|14 Sing, O daughter of Zion. Shout, O Israel. [.linebr]#/# +
Be glad and rejoice with all the heart, [.linebr]#/# +
O daughter of Jerusalem.

|
|15 The LORD has taken away your judgments. [.linebr]#/# +
He has cast out your enemy. [.linebr]#/# +
The King of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of you. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall not see evil anymore.

|
|16 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
"Do not fear, O Zion. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not let your hands be slack.

|
|17 The LORD your God in the midst of you is mighty. [.linebr]#/# +
He will save. [.linebr]#/# +
He will rejoice over you with joy. [.linebr]#/# +
He will rest in his love. [.linebr]#/# +
He will joy over you with singing.

|
|18 I will gather those among you [.linebr]#/# +
who are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, [.linebr]#/# +
to whom its reproach was a burden.

|
|19 Behold, at that time [.linebr]#/# +
I will deal with all who afflict you. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will save her who is lame [.linebr]#/# +
and gather her who was driven out. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will get them praise and fame [.linebr]#/# +
in every land where they have been put to shame.

|
|20 At that time I will bring you back, [.linebr]#/# +
even in the time that I gather you. [.linebr]#/# +
For I will make you a name and a praise [.linebr]#/# +
among all people of the earth [.linebr]#/# +
when I turn back your captivity before your eyes,"
|===

says the LORD.
