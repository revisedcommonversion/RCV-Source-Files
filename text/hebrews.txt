=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ in these last times coming to us from the Father, 1-3, is preferred above the angels, both in person and office, 4-14._

1 God, who at many times and in diverse manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 2 Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom he also made the universe. 3 He is the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made purification of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they have.

[[heb001-005]]5 For to which of the angels did he at any time say,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_You are my Son._ [.linebr]#/# +
_This day I have begotten you,_"

and again,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_I will be a Father to him,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and he shall be a Son to me_"?
|===

[[heb001-006]]6 And again, when he brings the first-begotten into the world, he says,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_And let all the angels of God worship him._"
|===

[[heb001-007]]7 And of the angels he says,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_He makes his angels spirits,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and his ministers a flame of fire._"
|===

[[heb001-008]]8 But to the Son, he says,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_Your throne, O God, is forever and ever._ [.linebr]#/# +
_A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom._

|
|[[heb001-009]]9 _You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity;_ [.linebr]#/# +
_therefore, God, even your God, has anointed you_ [.linebr]#/# +
_with the oil of gladness above your fellows._"
|===

[[heb001-010]]10 And,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and the heavens are the works of your hands._

|
|[[heb001-011]]11 _They shall perish, but you remain._ [.linebr]#/# +
_And they all shall become old as a garment does._

|
|[[heb001-012]]12 _And as a vesture you will fold them up,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and they shall be changed._ [.linebr]#/# +
_But you are the same,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and your years shall not fail._"
|===

[[heb001-013]]13 But to which of the angels did he at any time say,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_Sit on my right hand_ [.linebr]#/# +
_until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet_"?
|===

14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for those who shall inherit salvation?

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_We ought to be obedient to Christ Jesus, 1-4; and that because he condescended to take our nature upon him, 5-13; as it was necessary, 14-18._

1 Therefore, we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. 2 For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, 3 How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? It was spoken at the first by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him, 4 God also bearing them testimony, both with signs and wonders, and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.

5 For to the angels he has not put in subjection the world to come, concerning which we speak. [[heb002-006]]6 But someone in a certain place testified, saying,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_What is man that you are mindful of him,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_or the son of man that you visit him?_

|
|[[heb002-007]]7 _You made him a little lower than the angels._ [.linebr]#/# +
_You crowned him with glory and honor_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and set him over the works of your hands._

[[heb002-008]]8 _You have put all things in subjection under his feet._"
|===

For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not made subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him. 9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man.

10 For it was fitting for him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 11 For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers, [[heb002-012]]12 Saying,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_I will declare your name to my brothers._ [.linebr]#/# +
_In the midst of the church I will sing praise to you._"
|===

[[heb002-013]]13 And again,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_I will put my trust in him._"
|===

And again,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_Behold, I and the children which God has given me._"
|===

14 Since then the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same so that through death he might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, 15 And deliver those who through fear of death were all their life-time subject to bondage. 16 For truly he does not give help to angels, but he gives help to the offspring of Abraham. 17 Therefore, in all things it behooved him to be made like his brothers so that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 18 For in that he himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ is more worthy than Moses, 1-6; therefore if we do not believe in him, we shall be more worthy of punishment than hard-hearted Israel, 7-19._

1 Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus, [[heb003-002]]2 Who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was "_faithful in all his house._" 3 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, just as he who has built the house has more honor than the house. 4 For every house is built by some man, but he who built all things is God. [[heb003-005]]5 And Moses truly was "_faithful in all his house_" as a servant for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken. 6 But Christ is a son over his own house. We are his house, if we hold firmly to the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope steadfast to the end.

[[heb003-007]]7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_Today if you will hear his voice,_

|
|[[heb003-008]]8 _Do not harden your hearts as in the provocation,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_as in the day of testing in the wilderness,_

|
|[[heb003-009]]9 _When your fathers tested me, proved me,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and saw my works forty years._

|
|[[heb003-010]]10 _Therefore, I was grieved with that generation,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and said, 'They always err in their heart,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and they have not known my ways.'_

|
|[[heb003-011]]11 _So I swore in my wrath,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_'They shall not enter into my rest.'_"
|===

12 Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. 13 But exhort one another daily while it is called Today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 14 For we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, [[heb003-015]]15 While it is said,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_Today if you will hear his voice,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_do not harden your hearts as in the provocation._"
|===

16 For who, when they had heard, provoked? Was it not all who came out of Egypt by Moses? 17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? 18 And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who did not believe? 19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_The Christian rest is attained by faith, 1-11. The power of God's word, 12, 13. By our high priest Jesus, the Son of God, 14, 15, we may and must go boldly to the throne of grace, 16._

1 Let us therefore fear while a promise of entering into his rest remains, lest any of you should seem to come short of it. 2 For the gospel was preached to us as well as to them. But the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it. [[heb004-003]]3 For we who have believed enter into rest, as he said,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_As I have sworn in my wrath_ [.linebr]#/# +
_that they shall not enter into my rest,_"
|===

although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. [[heb004-004]]4 For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: "_And God rested the seventh day from all his works._" [[heb004-005]]5 And in this place again,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_They shall not enter into my rest._"
|===

6 Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter into it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of unbelief, [[heb004-007]]7 Again he limits a certain day, saying through David, "Today," after so long a time, as it is said,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_Today, if you will hear his voice,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_do not harden your hearts._"
|===

8 For if Joshua had given them rest, then he would not afterward have spoken of another day. 9 There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. 10 For he who has entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his. 11 Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. 12 For the word of God is living, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. 13 There is no creature that is not manifest in his sight. But all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

14 Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to our profession. 15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but who was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. 16 Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace so that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_The honor of our Savior's priesthood, 1-10. Negligence in the knowledge thereof is reproved, 11-14._

1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. 2 He can have compassion on the ignorant and on those who are out of the way, for he himself also is compassed with infirmity. 3 And by reason of this he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. 4 And no man takes this honor to himself, but he is called by God, as was Aaron.

[[heb005-005]]5 So also Christ did not glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_You are my Son._ [.linebr]#/# +
_Today I have begotten you,_"
|===

[[heb005-006]]6 As he also says in another place,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_You are a priest forever_ [.linebr]#/# +
_after the order of Melchizedek._"
|===

7 He, in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, was heard because of his reverence. 8 Though he was a Son, yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered. 9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all those who obey him, 10 Called by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.

11 Concerning him, we have many things to say, and hard of interpretation, seeing you have become dull of hearing. 12 For when by the time you ought to be teachers, you have need of someone to teach you again what are the first principles of the oracles of God, and have become those who have need of milk and not of strong food. 13 For everyone who partakes of milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby. 14 But strong food belongs to those who are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_The author exhorts not to fall back from the faith, 1-10; but to be steadfast, 11, diligent, and patient to wait upon God, 12; because God is most sure in his promise, 13-20._

1 Therefore, leaving the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, 2 Of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. 3 And this we will do, if God permits. 4 For it is impossible for those who have been once enlightened, have tasted the heavenly gift, have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, 5 And have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, 6 If they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God again and put him to an open shame. 7 For the ground which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it and brings forth herbs fit for them by whom it is dressed receives a blessing from God. 8 But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected and is near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.

9 But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, though we speak in this manner. 10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have shown toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints and still minister. 11 And we desire each of you to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end, 12 So that you do not become slothful, but followers of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

13 For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself, [[heb006-014]]14 Saying, "_Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you._" 15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. 16 For men truly swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all contradiction. 17 In this, God, more abundantly willing to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath, 18 So that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. 19 This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil, [[heb006-020]]20 Where the forerunner has for us entered, even Jesus, made a high "_priest forever after the order of Melchizedek._"

=== Chapter 7

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ Jesus is a priest after the order of Melchizedek, 1-10, and so far more excellent than the priests of Aaron's order, 11-28._

1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace, 3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, abides a priest continually.

4 Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the plunder. 5 And truly those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they come from the loins of Abraham. 6 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. 7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed by the better. 8 And here men who die receive tithes, but there he receives them, of whom it is testified that he lives. 9 And as I may say, Levi also, who receives tithes, payed tithes through Abraham. 10 For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.

11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Aaron? 12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change of the law also. 13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. 14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood. 15 And it is yet far more evident if after the similitude of Melchizedek there arises another priest, 16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. [[heb007-017]]17 For he testifies,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_You are a priest forever_ [.linebr]#/# +
_after the order of Melchizedek._"
|===

18 For there is truly a setting aside of the preceding commandment on account of its weakness and unprofitableness. 19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the introduction of a better hope did, by which we draw near to God. 20 And since he was not made priest without an oath [[heb007-021]]21 (For those priests were made without an oath, but this with an oath by him who said to him,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_The Lord swore and will not repent,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_'You are a priest forever_ [.linebr]#/# +
_after the order of Melchizedek'_"),
|===

22 By so much Jesus has become surety of a better testament.

23 And they truly were many priests because they were not allowed to continue by reason of death. 24 But this man, because he continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood; 25 Therefore, he is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God by him, seeing he always lives to make intercession for them.

26 For such a high priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens, 27 Who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins and then for the people's. For this he did once when he offered up himself. 28 For the law appoints men as high priests who have infirmity, but the word of the oath which was after the law appoints the Son who has been perfected forevermore.

=== Chapter 8

[.outline.text-center]
_By the eternal priesthood of Christ the Levitical priesthood of Aaron is abolished, 1-6; and the temporal covenant with the fathers is abolished by the eternal covenant of the Gospel, 7-13._

1 Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: we have such a high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 2 A minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. 3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it is of necessity that this man should have something also to offer. 4 For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, seeing there are priests who offer gifts according to the law, [[heb008-005]]5 Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he says, "_See that you make all things according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain._" 6 But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.

7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for the second.

[[heb008-008]]8 For finding fault with them, he says,

_and each his brother, saying, "Know the Lord,"_ [.linebr]#/# +
_for all shall know me,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_from the least to the greatest._

|[[heb008-012]]12 _For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and their sins and their iniquities_ [.linebr]#/# +
_I will no longer remember.'_"

13 In that he says, "A new covenant," he has made the first old. Now that which decays and grows old is ready to vanish away.

In the first part was the candlestick, the table, and the show-bread, which is called the holy place. 3 And after the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies, 4 Which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid around with gold, in which was the golden pot that had manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant, 5 And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat, of which we cannot now speak particularly.

6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. 7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people. 8 The Holy Spirit is signifying this: that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing. 9 This was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him who did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience, 10 Which stood only in foods and drinks, diverse washings, and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation.

11 But Christ, having come as a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building, 12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. 13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh, 14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, so that, by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, those who are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance. 16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. 17 For a testament is of force after men are dead; otherwise, it is of no strength at all while the testator lives. 18 Therefore, even the first testament was not dedicated without blood. 19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book and all the people, [[heb009-020]]20 Saying, "_This is the blood of the testament which God has commanded you._" 21 And likewise, he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with blood. 22 And almost all things are by the law cleansed with blood. And without the shedding of blood there is no remission.

23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 24 For Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us, 25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others. 26 For then he would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world. But now once in the end of the age he has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 27 And as it is appointed to men once to die and after this the judgment, 28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many, and to those who look for him, he will appear the second time without sin for salvation.

=== Chapter 10

[.outline.text-center]
_The weakness of the law sacrifices, 1-9. The sacrifice of Christ's body once offered, 10-13, forever has taken away sins, 14-18. An exhortation to hold firmly to the faith with patience and thanksgiving, 19-39._

1 For the law, having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices, which they offered year by year continually, make perfect those who draw near. 2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, once cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins. 3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. 4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.

[[heb010-005]]5 Therefore, when he comes into the world, he says,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|
|"_Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_but you have prepared me a body._

_(in the volume of the book it is written concerning me)_ [.linebr]#/# +
_to do your will, O God.'_"
|===

[[heb010-008]]8 Above, when he said, "_'Sacrifice and offering_' and '_burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin you did not desire, neither had pleasure in them_'"—which are offered by the law— [[heb010-009]]9 Then he said, "_Behold, I come to do your will, O God._" He takes away the first so that he may establish the second, 10 By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

11 And every priest stands daily ministering and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. [[heb010-012]]12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, "_sat down on the right hand_" of God, [[heb010-013]]13 From now on waiting "_until his enemies are made his footstool for his feet._" 14 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified. 15 Of this the Holy Spirit is also a witness to us. For after that, he said,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|[[heb010-016]]16 "'_This is the covenant_ [.linebr]#/# +
_that I will make with them_ [.linebr]#/# +
_after those days,' says the Lord,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_'I will put my laws into their hearts,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and in their minds I will write them,_

|
|[[heb010-017]]17 _'And their sins and iniquities_ [.linebr]#/# +
_I will no longer remember.'_"
|===

18 Now where remission of these is, there is no longer any offering for sin.

19 Therefore, brothers, having boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, 20 By a new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, 21 And having a high priest over the house of God, 22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold firmly to the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful who promised. 24 And let us consider one another to excite to love and to good works, 25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.

26 For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains sacrifice for sins, 27 But a certain fearful apprehension of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. 28 He who despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses. 29 How much more severe a punishment do you suppose he shall be thought worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God, has counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has done an indignity to the Spirit of grace? [[heb010-030]]30 For we know him who has said, "_Vengeance belongs to me. I will recompense,_" says the Lord. And again, "_The Lord will judge his people._" 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions, 33 Partly while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions, and partly while you became companions of those who were thus used. 34 For you had compassion on me in my bonds and joyfully took the seizing of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. 35 Therefore, do not cast away your confidence, which has great recompense of reward. 36 For you have need of patience so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise.

_What faith is, 1-5. Without faith we cannot please God, 6. The worthy fruits thereof in the fathers of old time, 7-40._

1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.

3 Through faith we understand that the universe was framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which appeared. 4 By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts. And by faith he, being dead, yet speaks. [[heb011-005]]5 By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death, "_and was not found, because God had translated him._" For before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 6 But without faith it is impossible to please him. For he who comes to God must believe that he exists and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. 7 By faith Noah, being warned by God of things not seen as yet and moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

8 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should afterward receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and he went out not knowing where he was going. 9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise. 10 For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God. 11 Through faith, Sarah herself also received strength to conceive offspring, and delivered a child when she was past age, since she judged him faithful who had promised. 12 Therefore, there sprang even from one—and him as good as dead—so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea-shore innumerable.

13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 14 For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. 15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from where they came, they might have had opportunity to return. 16 But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.

17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac. And he who had received the promises offered up his only-begotten son, [[heb011-018]]18 Of whom it was said, "_In Isaac your offspring shall be called._" 19 He accounted that God was able to raise him even from the dead, from where also he received him in a figure. 20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. [[heb011-021]]21 By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph "_and worshiped while leaning upon the top of his staff._" 22 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones.

23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents because they saw he was an exceedingly fair child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. 24 By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, 25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, 26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he had respect to the recompense of the reward. 27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, and he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 28 Through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the first-born should touch them. 29 By faith they passed through the Red Sea as if by dry land, which the Egyptians essaying to do were drowned.

30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encompassed seven days. 31 By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, as she had received the spies with peace.

32 And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, of Barak, of Samson, of Jephthah, of David, of Samuel, and of the prophets, 33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the foreigners. 35 Women received their dead raised to life again. Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, so that they might obtain a better resurrection. 36 Others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings and also of bonds and imprisonment. 37 They were stoned. They were sawn apart. They were tempted. They were slain with the sword. They wandered around in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented 38 (Of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

39 And all of these, having obtained a good report through faith, did not receive the promise— 40 God having provided something better for us—so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.

[.outline.text-center]
_An exhortation to constant faith, patience, and godliness, 1-21. A commendation of the new testament above the old, 22-29._

1 Therefore, seeing we also are encompassed with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily besets us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, 2 Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3 Consider him who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.

4 You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin. [[heb012-005]]5 And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to children:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"_My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_nor faint when you are rebuked by him._

|
|[[heb012-006]]6 _For whom the Lord loves he chastens,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and scourges every son whom he receives._"
|===

7 If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons. For what son is he whom the father does not chasten? 8 But if you are without chastisement, of which all are partakers, then you are illegitimate sons and not sons. 9 Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and we gave them reverence. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? 10 For they truly for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure, but he for our profit, so that we might be partakers of his holiness. 11 Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous. Nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who are exercised by it.

[[heb012-012]]12 Therefore, "_lift up the weakened hands and the feeble knees,_" 13 And make straight paths for your feet so that what is lame may not be turned out of the way, but rather be healed.

14 Follow peace with all men, and also holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. 15 Look diligently, lest any man fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up, trouble you, and by it many be defiled; 16 Lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who sold his birth-right for one morsel of food. 17 For you know that afterward, when he wished to have inherited the blessing, he was rejected. For he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

18 For you have not come to the mountain that might be touched and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, to darkness, to tempest, 19 To the sound of a trumpet, or the voice of words, which those who heard the voice entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore. [[heb012-020]]20 For they could not endure that which was commanded: "And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, _'it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart.'_" 21 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, "I exceedingly fear and tremble." 22 But you have come to mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, 23 To the general assembly and church of the first-born who are written in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, 24 To Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.

25 See that you do not refuse him who speaks. For if those did not escape who refused him who spoke on earth, much more we shall not escape if we turn away from him who speaks from heaven. [[heb012-026]]26 His voice then shook the earth, but now he has promised, saying, "_Yet once more I do not shake the earth only, but also heaven._" 27 And this word, "Yet once more," signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. 28 Therefore, receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear, [[heb012-029]]29 For "_our God is a consuming fire._"

7 Remember your leaders, who spoke to you the word of God. Follow their faith, considering the end of their manner of life. 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. 9 Do not be carried away with diverse and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart is established with grace, not with foods, which have not profited those who have been occupied in them. 10 We have an altar, from which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle. 11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp. 12 Therefore, Jesus also, so that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered outside the gate. 13 Let us go forth therefore to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach. 14 For here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

[[heb013-015]]15 Therefore, by him, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, "_the fruit of our lips,_" giving thanks to his name. 16 But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.

17 Obey your leaders and submit yourselves, for they watch for your souls as those who must give account, so that they may do it with joy and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you.

18 Pray for us, for we trust we have a good conscience, desiring to live honestly in all things. 19 But I implore you the rather to do this so that I may be restored to you more quickly.

20 Now may the God of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, 21 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

22 And I implore you, brothers, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written a letter to you in few words. 23 Know that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you. 24 Salute all of your leaders and all the saints. Those of Italy salute you.

25 May grace be with you all. Amen.
