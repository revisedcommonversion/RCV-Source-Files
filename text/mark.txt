4 John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 5 And all the land of Judea and those of Jerusalem went out there to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, with a leather girdle around his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 7 And he preached, saying, "There comes after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 8 I indeed have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."

9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth to Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 10 And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. 11 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

12 And immediately the Spirit drives him into the wilderness. 13 And he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him.

14 Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 15 And saying, "[.woc]#The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the gospel.#"

16 Now as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 17 And Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#Come after me and I will make you become fishers of men.#" 18 And immediately they forsook their nets and followed him. 19 And when he had gone a little farther from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets. 20 And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after him.

21 And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught. 22 And they were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. 23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 24 Saying, "Leave us alone. What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God." 25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "[.woc]#Hold your peace and come out of him.#" 26 And when the unclean spirit had convulsed him and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 27 And they were all amazed; therefore, they questioned among themselves, saying, "What thing is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him." 28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region around Galilee.

29 And immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 30 But the mother of Simon's wife lay sick with a fever, and immediately they tell him about her. 31 And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. And immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them.

32 And at evening when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were diseased and those who were possessed with demons. 33 And all the city was gathered at the door. 34 And he healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. And he did not allow the demons to speak because they knew him.

35 And in the morning, rising a great while before day, he went out and departed into a solitary place and prayed there. 36 And Simon and those who were with him followed after him. 37 And when they had found him, they said to him, "All men seek for you." 38 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Let us go into the next towns so that I may preach there also, for I have come for this purpose.#" 39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and cast out demons.

40 And there came a leper to him, imploring him, and kneeling down to him and saying to him, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." 41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand and touched him, and says to him, "[.woc]#I am willing. Be clean.#" 42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed. 43 And he strictly charged him and immediately sent him away, 44 And says to him, "[.woc]#See that you say nothing to any man. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.#" 45 But he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze abroad the matter; therefore, Jesus could no longer openly enter into the city, but was outside in desolate places. And they came to him from every quarter.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ, followed by multitudes, 1, 2, heals someone of paralysis, 3-12; calls Matthew from the receipt of custom, 13, 14; eats with tax collectors and sinners, 15-17; excuses his disciples for not fasting, 18-22; and for plucking the heads of grain on the sabbath-day, 23-28._

1 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days, and it was understood that he was in the house. 2 And immediately many were assembled so that there was no room to receive them, not even at the door. And he preached the word to them. 3 And they come to him, bringing someone paralyzed who was carried by four men. 4 And when they could not come near to him by reason of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was. And when they had broken it up, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "[.woc]#Son, your sins are forgiven.#" 6 But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 7 "Why does this man thus speak blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?" 8 And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they thus reasoned within themselves, he said to them, "[.woc]#Why do you reason these things in your hearts?# 9 [.woc]#Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise, take up your bed, and walk'?# 10 [.woc]#But so that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins#"—he says to the paralytic— 11 "[.woc]#I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go into your house.#" 12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all. Therefore, they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw it in this fashion."

13 And he went forth again by the sea-side, and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.

14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alpheus, sitting at the receipt of custom, and said to him, "[.woc]#Follow me.#" And he arose and followed him.

15 And it came to pass, that as Jesus sat at the table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many and they followed him. 16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, "How is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?" 17 When Jesus heard it, he says to them, "[.woc]#Those who are in health have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.#"

18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting, and they come, and say to him, "Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" 19 And Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.# 20 [.woc]#But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days.#

21 "[.woc]#No man also sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment, or else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old and the rent is made worse.# 22 [.woc]#And no man puts new wine into old bottles, or else the new wine bursts the bottles, and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred. But new wine must be put into new bottles.#"

23 And it came to pass, that he went through the grain-fields on the sabbath, and his disciples began to pluck the heads of grain as they made their way. 24 And the Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do on the sabbath that which is not lawful?" 25 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry—he and those who were with him—# 26 [.woc]#How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest and ate the show-bread, which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?#" 27 And he said to them, "[.woc]#The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.# 28 [.woc]#Therefore, the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.#"

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ heals the withered hand, 1-9, and many other infirmities, 10; rebukes the unclean spirit, 11, 12; chooses his twelve apostles, 13-21; convinces the blasphemy of casting out demons by Beelzebub, 22-30; and shows who are his brother, sister, and mother, 31-35._

1 And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand. 2 And they watched him to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath so that they might accuse him. 3 And he says to the man who had the withered hand, "[.woc]#Stand forth.#" 4 And he says to them, "[.woc]#Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath or to do evil, to save life or to kill?#" But they held their peace. 5 And when he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he says to the man, "[.woc]#Stretch forth your hand.#" And he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other. 6 And the Pharisees went forth and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

7 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea, 8 From Jerusalem, from Idumea, from beyond the Jordan, and those around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude came to him when they had heard what great things he did. 9 And he told his disciples that a small boat should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him, 10 For he had healed many; therefore, as many as had diseases pressed upon him to touch him. 11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried, saying, "You are the Son of God." 12 And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.

13 And he goes up upon a mountain and calls to him whom he wished, and they came to him. 14 And he ordained twelve so that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach, 15 To have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons: 16 Simon he surnamed Peter, 17 James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, Sons of Thunder), 18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, Thaddeus, Simon the Canaanite, 19 And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. They went into a house.

20 And the multitude comes together again so that they could not so much as eat bread. 21 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold upon him, for they said, "He is beside himself." 22 And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem, said, "He has Beelzebub, and by the prince of the demons he casts out demons." 23 And he called them to him and said to them in parables, "[.woc]#How can Satan cast out Satan?# 24 [.woc]#And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.# 25 [.woc]#And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.# 26 [.woc]#And if Satan rises up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.# 27 [.woc]#No man can enter into a strong man's house and seize his goods unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.#

28 "[.woc]#Truly I say to you, the sons of men shall be forgiven of all sins and any blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme.# 29 [.woc]#But he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal condemnation#"— 30 Because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."

31 Then his brothers and his mother came there, and standing outside they sent to him, calling him. 32 And the multitude sat around him, and they said to him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers outside seek for you." 33 And he answered them, saying, "[.woc]#Who is my mother, or my brothers?#" 34 And he looked around at those who sat around him, and said, "[.woc]#Behold, my mother and my brothers!# 35 [.woc]#For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, my sister, and mother.#"

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_The parable of the sower, 1-13, and the meaning thereof, 14-20. We must communicate the light of our knowledge to others, 21-25. The parable of the seed growing secretly, 26-29; and of the mustard seed, 30-34. Christ stills the tempest on the sea, 35-41._

1 And he began again to teach by the sea-side. And there was gathered to him a great multitude so that he entered into a boat and sat on the sea, while the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. 2 And he taught them many things by parables and said to them in his doctrine, 3 "[.woc]#Listen. Behold, a sower went out to sow.# 4 [.woc]#And it came to pass as he sowed, some fell by the wayside and the birds of the air came and devoured it.# 5 [.woc]#And some fell on stony ground where it did not have much earth. And immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.# 6 [.woc]#But when the sun had risen, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered away.# 7 [.woc]#And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.# 8 [.woc]#And others fell on good ground and yielded fruit that sprang up, increased, and brought forth, some thirty-, some sixty-, and some one hundred-fold.#" 9 And he said to them, "[.woc]#He who has ears to hear, let him hear.#"

10 And when he was alone, those who were around him, with the twelve, asked him about the parable. 11 And he said to them, "[.woc]#To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all these things are done in parables,# [[mrk004-012]]12 [.woc]#So that#

[.woc]#_lest at any time they should be converted_# [.linebr]#/# +
[.woc]#_and their sins should be forgiven._'#"

13 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Do you not know this parable? And how then will you know all parables?# 14 [.woc]#The sower sows the word.# 15 [.woc]#And these are those by the wayside where the word is sown, but when they have heard, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.# 16 [.woc]#And likewise, these are those who are sown on stony ground, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness,# 17 [.woc]#And have no root in themselves, and so endure only for a time. Afterward, when affliction or persecution arises for the word's sake, immediately they relapse.# 18 [.woc]#And these are those who are sown among thorns: those who hear the word,# 19 [.woc]#And the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.# 20 [.woc]#And these are those who are sown on good ground: those who hear the word, receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty-, some sixty-, and some one hundred-fold.#"

21 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Is a candle brought to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not to be set on a candlestick?# 22 [.woc]#For there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested, neither has anything been kept secret, but that it should come abroad.# 23 [.woc]#If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.#" 24 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Take heed what you hear. With the measure which you give, it shall be measured to you. And to you who hear, more shall be given.# 25 [.woc]#For he who has, to him shall be given, and he who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken from him.#"

26 And he said, "[.woc]#The kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed into the ground.# 27 [.woc]#And he sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed springs and grows up, though he does not know how.# 28 [.woc]#For the earth brings forth fruit by itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head.# 29 [.woc]#But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puts in the sickle because the harvest has come.#"

30 And he said, "[.woc]#To what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or with what comparison shall we compare it?# 31 [.woc]#It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth.# [[mrk004-032]]32 [.woc]#But when it is sown, it grows up, becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches so that the '_birds of the air may lodge under its shade._'#"

33 And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. 34 But without a parable he did not speak to them. And when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.

35 And the same day, when the evening had come, he says to them, "[.woc]#Let us pass over to the other side.#" 36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the boat. And there were also with him other small boats. 37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat so that it was now full. 38 And he was in the back part of the boat asleep on a pillow. And they wake him, and say to him, "Master, do you not care that we perish?" 39 And he arose, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "[.woc]#Peace, be still,#" and the wind ceased and there was a great calm. 40 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?#" 41 And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, "What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ delivering the man possessed with the legion of demons, 1-12, they enter into the swine, 13-21. He is entreated by Jairus to go and heal his daughter, 22-24. He heals the woman of the bloody issue, 25-34, and raises from death Jairus' daughter, 35-43._

1 And they came over to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. 2 And when he had come out of the boat, immediately out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit met him there, 3 Who had his dwelling among the tombs. And no man could bind him, not even with chains, 4 For he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked apart by him and the fetters broken in pieces. No man could tame him. 5 And always, night and day, he was on the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones. 6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped him, 7 And cried with a loud voice, and said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, that you do not torment me." 8 (For he said to him, "[.woc]#Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.#") 9 And he asked him, "[.woc]#What is your name?#" And he answered, saying, "My name is Legion, for we are many." 10 And he implored him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 11 Now there was a great herd of swine feeding near the mountains. 12 And all the demons implored him, saying, "Send us into the swine so that we may enter into them." 13 And immediately Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea (they were about two thousand) and were choked in the sea.

14 And those who fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. 15 And they come to Jesus and see him who was possessed with the demon and had the legion sitting there clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. 16 And those who saw it told them how it befell him who was possessed with the demon, and also concerning the swine. 17 And they began to beg him to depart out of their borders. 18 And when he had come into the boat, he who had been possessed with the demon begged him that he might be with him. 19 Yet Jesus did not allow him, but says to him, "[.woc]#Go home to your friends and tell them how the Lord has done great things for you and has had compassion on you.#" 20 And he departed and began to publish in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him. And all men wondered.

21 And when Jesus had passed over again in a boat to the other side, many people gathered to him. And he was near the sea. 22 And behold, there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, 23 And implored him greatly, saying, "My little daughter lies at the point of death. I pray you, come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed, and she will live." 24 And Jesus went with him, and many people followed him and thronged him.

25 And a certain woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years, 26 Had suffered many things from many physicians, and had spent all that she had and was not relieved, but rather grew worse, 27 When she had heard of Jesus, she came in the crowd behind and touched his garment. 28 For she said, "If I only touch his clothes, I shall be whole." 29 And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that infirmity. 30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that power had gone out of him, turned himself around in the throng, and said, "[.woc]#Who touched my clothes?#" 31 And his disciples said to him, "You see the multitude thronging you and you say, 'Who touched me?'" 32 And he looked around to see her who had done this thing. 33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him and told him all the truth. 34 And he said to her, "[.woc]#Daughter, your faith has made you whole. Go in peace and be healed of your infirmity.#"

35 While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house some who said, "Your daughter is dead. Why do you trouble the Master any further?" 36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he says to the ruler of the synagogue, "[.woc]#Do not be afraid, only believe.#" 37 And he allowed no man to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. 38 And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and sees the tumult and those who wept and wailed greatly. 39 And when he had come in, he says to them, "[.woc]#Why do you make this tumult and weep? The girl is not dead, but sleeps.#" 40 And they derided him. But when he had put them all out, he takes the father and the mother of the girl and those who were with him and enters in where the girl was lying. 41 And he took the girl by the hand and said to her, "[.woc]#Talitha cumi,#" (which is, being interpreted, "Girl, I say to you, arise"). 42 And immediately the girl arose and walked. She was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. 43 And he charged them strictly that no man should know it, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ is despised by his countrymen, 1-6. He gives the twelve power over unclean spirits, 7-13. Various opinions of Christ, 14, 15. John the Baptist is imprisoned, beheaded, and buried, 16-29. The apostles return from preaching, 30-33. The miracle of five loaves and two fish, 34-44. Christ walks on the sea, 45-52; and heals all who touch him, 53-56._

1 And he went out from there and came into his own country, and his disciples followed him. 2 And when the sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many who heard him were astonished, saying, "From where did this man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? 3 Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? And are his sisters not here with us?" And they were offended at him. 4 But Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, among his own kindred, and in his own house.#" 5 And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick persons and healed them. 6 And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went around the villages teaching.

7 And he calls the twelve to him and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits. 8 And he commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only—no bag, no bread, no money in their purse— 9 But to be shod with sandals and not put on two coats. 10 And he said to them, "[.woc]#In whatever place you enter into a house, abide there until you depart from that place.# 11 [.woc]#And whoever does not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Truly I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.#" 12 And they went out and preached that men should repent. 13 And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.

14 And king Herod heard about him (for his name was spread abroad), and he said, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and therefore, mighty works show themselves forth in him." 15 Others said, "It is Elijah." And others said, "It is a prophet, or like one of the prophets." 16 But when Herod heard of him, he said, "It is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead."

17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her. 18 For John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." 19 Therefore, Herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him, but she could not, 20 For Herod feared John and kept him safe, knowing that he was a just and holy man. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed, yet he heard him gladly. 21 And when a convenient day had come, Herod, on his birthday, made a supper for his lords, high captains, and chief men of Galilee. 22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those who sat with him. And the king said to the girl, "Ask of me whatever you wish and I will give it to you." 23 And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you, up to half of my kingdom." 24 And she went forth and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist." 25 And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, "I wish that you would give me at once the head of John the Baptist in a dish." 26 And the king was exceedingly sorry. Yet for his oath's sake and for their sakes who sat with him, he would not reject her. 27 And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in the prison, 28 And brought his head in a dish and gave it to the girl. And the girl gave it to her mother. 29 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.

30 And the apostles assembled themselves to Jesus and told him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. 31 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Come separately into a desolate place and rest a while.#" For there were many coming and going and they did not even have opportunity to eat. 32 And they departed into a desolate place in a boat privately.

33 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him. And they ran there together on foot out of all cities and went ahead of them. 34 And Jesus, when he came out, saw many people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. 35 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, and said, "This is a desolate place and now the time is far passed. 36 Send them away so that they may go into the country around and into the villages and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat." 37 He answered and said to them, "[.woc]#You give them something to eat.#" And they say to him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?" 38 He says to them, "[.woc]#How many loaves do you have? Go and see.#" And when they knew, they say, "Five, and two fish." 39 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass. 40 And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties. 41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them. He also divided the two fish among them all. 42 And they all ate and were satisfied. 43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fish. 44 And those who ate of the loaves were about five thousand men.

45 And immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the boat and to go to the other side ahead of him to Bethsaida while he sent the people away. 46 And when he had dismissed them, he departed to a mountain to pray.

47 And when evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land. 48 And he saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them. 49 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out. 50 (For they all saw him and were troubled.) And immediately he talked with them, and says to them, "[.woc]#Be of good cheer. It is I. Do not be afraid.#" 51 Then he went up to them into the boat, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered. 52 For they did not consider the miracle of the loaves, but their heart was hardened.

53 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shore. 54 And when they had come out of the boat, immediately they knew him, 55 And ran throughout that whole region and began to carry around in beds those who were sick where they heard he was. 56 And wherever he entered, into villages, cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets and implored him that they might touch at least the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched him were healed.

[.outline.text-center]
_The Pharisees find fault with the disciples for eating with unwashed hands, 1-7. They break the commandment of God by the traditions of men, 8-13. Nothing from outside a man can defile him, 14-23. He heals the Syrophenician woman's daughter of an unclean spirit, 24-30; and someone who was deaf and stammered in his speech, 31-37._

1 Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who came from Jerusalem came together to him. 2 And when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled (that is to say with unwashed) hands, they found fault. 3 For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands often, holding the tradition of the elders. 4 And when they come from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other things which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, pots, brazen vessels, and tables. 5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?" [[mrk007-006]]6 He answered and said to them, "[.woc]#Isaiah has prophesied well concerning you hypocrites, as it is written,#

|===

8 [.woc]#For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, such as the washing of pots and cups. And you do many other similar things.#"

9 And he said to them, "[.woc]#You full well reject the commandment of God in order to keep your own tradition,# [[mrk007-010]]10 [.woc]#For Moses said, '_Honor your father and your mother,_' and, '_Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death._'# 11 [.woc]#But you say, 'If a man says to his father or mother, "Whatever you might be profited by me is Corban," (that is to say, a gift to God) he shall be free.'# 12 [.woc]#And you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,# 13 [.woc]#Making the word of God of no effect through your traditions, which you have delivered. And you do many similar things.#"

14 And when he had called all the people to him, he said to them, "[.woc]#Listen to me, each of you, and understand.# 15 [.woc]#There is nothing from outside a man, that entering into him can defile him; however, it is the things which come out of him that defile the man.# 16 [.woc]#If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.#"

17 And when he had entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 18 And he says to them, "[.woc]#Are you so void of understanding also? Do you not perceive, that whatever thing from outside enters into the man, it cannot defile him,# 19 [.woc]#Because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the latrine, purging all kinds of food?#" 20 And he said, "[.woc]#That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man.# 21 [.woc]#For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts: adulteries, fornications, murders,# 22 [.woc]#Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.# 23 [.woc]#All these evil things come from within and defile the man.#"

24 And from there he arose and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house and wished to have no man know it, but he could not be hid. 25 But a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet 26 (The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation), and she implored him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter. 27 But Jesus said to her, "[.woc]#Let the children first be satisfied, for it is not proper to take the children's bread and to cast it to the dogs.#" 28 And she answered and said to him, "Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs." 29 And he said to her, "[.woc]#For this saying, depart. The demon has gone out of your daughter.#" 30 And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

31 And again, departing from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. 32 And they bring to him someone who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they implore him to put his hand upon him. 33 And he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears, and having spit he touched his tongue. 34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed and says to him, "[.woc]#Effatha,#" (that is, "Be opened"). 35 And immediately his ears were opened, the string of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly. 36 And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it, 37 And were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak."

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ feeds the people miraculously, 1-9; refuses to give a sign to the Pharisees, 10-13; admonishes his disciples to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod, 14-21; gives a blind man his sight, 22-26; acknowledges that he is the Christ who should suffer and rise again, 27-33; and exhorts to patience in persecution for the profession of the gospel, 34-38._

1 In those days when the multitude was very great and had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples and says to them, 2 "[.woc]#I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat.# 3 [.woc]#And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way, for some of them came from a distance.#" 4 And his disciples answered him, "From where can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?" 5 And he asked them, "[.woc]#How many loaves do you have?#" And they said, "Seven." 6 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to set before them, and they set them before the people. 7 They also had a few small fish. And he blessed them, and commanded these also to be set before them. 8 So they ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets of the fragments that were left. 9 And those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he dismissed them. 10 And immediately he entered into a boat with his disciples and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

11 And the Pharisees came forth and began to question with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, testing him. 12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and says, "[.woc]#Why does this generation seek for a sign? Truly I say to you, there shall no sign be given to this generation.#" 13 And having left them, and having entered into the boat again, he departed to the other side.

14 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither did they have in the boat with them more than one loaf. 15 And he charged them saying, "[.woc]#Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod.#" 16 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "It is because we have no bread." 17 And when Jesus knew it, he says to them, "[.woc]#Why do you discuss that you have no bread? Do you still not perceive or understand? Is your heart still hardened?# 18 [.woc]#Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember,# 19 [.woc]#When I divided the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?#" They say to him, "Twelve." 20 "[.woc]#And when I divided the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?#" And they said, "Seven." 21 And he said to them, "[.woc]#How is it that you do not understand?#"

22 And he comes to Bethsaida, and they bring a blind man to him and implored him to touch him. 23 And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw anything. 24 And he looked up, and said, "I see men as trees walking." 25 After that, he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up. Then he was restored and saw every man clearly. 26 And he sent him away to his house, saying, "[.woc]#Neither go into the town, nor tell it to anyone in the town.#"

27 And Jesus went out, along with his disciples, into the towns of Cesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, "[.woc]#Who do men say that I am?#" 28 And they answered, "'John the Baptist.' But some say, 'Elijah,' and others, 'One of the prophets.'" 29 And he says to them, "[.woc]#But who do you say that I am?#" And Peter answers and says to him, "You are the Christ." 30 And he charged them that they should tell no man about him.

31 And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 32 And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter took him and began to rebuke him. 33 But when he had turned around and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, "[.woc]#Get behind me, Satan. For you do not savor the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.#"

34 And when he had called the people to him with his disciples also, he said to them, "[.woc]#Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.# 35 [.woc]#For whoever will save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.# 36 [.woc]#For what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul?# 37 [.woc]#Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?# 38 [.woc]#Whoever therefore is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.#"

_Jesus is transfigured, 2-10. He instructs his disciples concerning the coming of Elijah, 11-13; casts out a deaf and mute spirit, 14-29; foretells his death and resurrection, 30-32; exhorts his disciples to humility, 33-37; bidding them not to prohibit those who are not against them, nor to give offense to any of the faithful, 38-50._

1 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Truly I say to you that there are some of those who stand here who shall not taste death until they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.#"

2 And after six days, Jesus takes with him Peter, James, and John, and leads them up upon a high mountain separately by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, 3 And his clothing became shining, exceedingly white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them. 4 And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. 5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." 6 For he did not know what to say, for they were greatly terrified. 7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son. Hear him." 8 And suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no one with them anymore, except Jesus only.

9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen until the Son of man was risen from the dead. 10 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning with one another what the rising from the dead should mean. 11 And they asked him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" 12 And he answered and told them, "[.woc]#Elijah truly comes first and restores all things. How is it written concerning the Son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at nothing?# 13 [.woc]#But I say to you, that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they pleased, as it is written concerning him.#"

14 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude around them and the scribes questioning with them. 15 And immediately, when they beheld him, all the people were greatly amazed and ran to him and saluted him. 16 And he asked the scribes, "[.woc]#What are you questioning with them?#" 17 And someone from the multitude answered and said, "Master, I have brought to you my son who has a mute spirit. 18 And wherever he takes him, he convulses him, and he foams and gnashes with his teeth and pines away. And I spoke to your disciples so that they should cast him out, and they could not." 19 He answered him, and says, "[.woc]#O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.#" 20 And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming. 21 And he asked his father, "[.woc]#How long has it been since this came to him?#" And he said, "From a child. 22 And it has often cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us." 23 Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.#" 24 And immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, "Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief." 25 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, "[.woc]#You mute and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him and enter into him no more.#" 26 And the spirit cried, shook him severely, and came out of him. And he was as one dead, so that many said, "He is dead." 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. 28 And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why could we not cast him out?" 29 And he said to them, "[.woc]#This kind can come forth by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.#"

30 And they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and he did not wish that any man should know it. 31 For he taught his disciples and said to them, "[.woc]#The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men and they will kill him, and after he is killed, he will rise on the third day.#" 32 But they did not understand that saying and were afraid to ask him.

33 And he came to Capernaum. And being in the house, he asked them, "[.woc]#What was it that you disputed among yourselves on the way?#" 34 But they held their peace, for on the way they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest. 35 And he sat down and called the twelve and says to them, "[.woc]#If any man desires to be first, the same shall be last of all and servant of all.#" 36 And he took a child and set him in the midst of them, and when he had taken him in his arms, he said to them, 37 "[.woc]#Whoever receives one of such children in my name receives me, and whoever receives me does not receive me, but him who sent me.#"

38 And John answered him, saying, "Master, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he does not follow us." 39 But Jesus said, "[.woc]#Do not forbid him. For there is no man who does a miracle in my name who can lightly speak evil of me.# 40 [.woc]#For he who is not against us is on our part.# 41 [.woc]#For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.#

42 "[.woc]#And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to fall into sin, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck and he were cast into the sea.# 43 [.woc]#And if your hand causes you to fall into sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched,# [[mrk009-044]]44 [.woc]#'_Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched._'# 45 [.woc]#And if your foot causes you to fall into sin, cut it off.

It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be cast into hell-fire,# [[mrk009-048]]48 [.woc]#'_Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched._'#

49 "[.woc]#For everyone shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.# 50 [.woc]#Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves and have peace with one another.#"

_Christ disputes with the Pharisees concerning divorce, 1-12 blesses the children who are brought to him, 13-16; resolves a rich man how he may inherit eternal life, 17-22; tells his disciples about the danger of riches, 23-27; promises rewards to those who forsake anything for the gospel, 28-31; foretells his death and resurrection, 32-34; bids the two ambitious appealers to think rather of suffering with him, 35-45; and restores to Bartimeus his sight, 46-52._

1 And he arose from there and comes into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. And the people resort to him again, and, as he was accustomed, he taught them again.

2 And the Pharisees came to him to test him, and asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?" 3 And he answered and said to them, "[.woc]#What did Moses command you?#" [[mrk010-004]]4 And they said, "Moses '_allowed a man to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away._'" 5 And Jesus answered and said to them, "[.woc]#For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.# [[mrk010-006]]6 [.woc]#But from the beginning of creation, '_God made them male and female._'# [[mrk010-007]]7 [.woc]#'_For this cause a man leaves his father and mother and cleaves to his wife,_# [[mrk010-008]]8 [.woc]#_And the two of them become one flesh,_' so then they are no longer two, but one flesh.# 9 [.woc]#Therefore, what God has joined together, do not let man separate.#"

10 And in the house his disciples asked him again about the same matter. 11 And he says to them, "[.woc]#Whoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.# 12 [.woc]#And if a woman puts away her husband and is married to another, she commits adultery.#"

13 And they brought young children to him so that he might touch them, and his disciples rebuked those who brought them. 14 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said to them, "[.woc]#Allow the little children to come to me and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.# 15 [.woc]#Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter it.#" 16 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

17 And when he had gone forth into the way, someone came running, kneeled to him, and asked him, "Good Master, what shall I do so that I may inherit eternal life?" 18 And Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Why do you call me good? No one is good, but one: God.# [[mrk010-019]]19 [.woc]#You know the commandments, '_Do not commit adultery,_' '_Do not kill,_' '_Do not steal,_' '_Do not bear false witness,_' '_Do not defraud,_' and, '_Honor your father and mother._'#" 20 And he answered and said to him, "Master, all these I have observed from my youth." 21 Then Jesus, beholding him, loved him and said to him, "[.woc]#You lack one thing: go and sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. Then come, take up the cross, and follow me.#" 22 And he was sad at that saying and went away grieved, for he had great possessions.

23 And Jesus looked around and says to his disciples, "[.woc]#How hardly those who have riches shall enter into the kingdom of God!#" 24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answers again, and says to them, "[.woc]#Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!# 25 [.woc]#It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.#" 26 And they were astonished beyond measure, saying among themselves, "Who then can be saved?" 27 And Jesus looking upon them, says, "[.woc]#With men it is impossible, but not with God. For with God all things are possible.#"

28 Then Peter began to say to him, "Behold, we have left all and have followed you." 29 Jesus answered and said, "[.woc]#Truly I say to you, there is no man who has left house, brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife, children, or lands for my sake and the gospel's,# 30 [.woc]#Who shall not receive one hundred-fold now in this time—houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and lands, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.# 31 [.woc]#But many who are first shall be last, and the last first.#"

32 And they were on the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them. And they were amazed, and as they followed, they were afraid. And again he took the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen to him, 33 Saying, "[.woc]#Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and will deliver him to the Gentiles,# 34 [.woc]#And they will mock him, scourge him, spit upon him, and kill him. But on the third day he will rise again.#"

35 And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him, saying, "Master, we wish that you should do for us whatever we desire." 36 And he said to them, "[.woc]#What do you wish that I should do for you?#" 37 They said to him, "Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand and the other on your left hand in your glory." 38 But Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#You do not know what you ask. Can you drink of the cup that I drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?#" 39 And they said to him, "We can." And Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of, and with the baptism that I am baptized with you shall be baptized.# 40 [.woc]#But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give. It shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.#"

41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John. 42 But Jesus called them, and says to them, "[.woc]#You know that those who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them.# 43 [.woc]#But it shall not be so among you. But whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your minister,# 44 [.woc]#And whoever of you wishes to be the chief shall be servant of all.# 45 [.woc]#For even the Son of man did not come to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom for many.#"

46 And they came to Jericho. And as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, sat by the highway-side begging. 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me." 48 And many charged him that he should hold his peace, but he cried the more a great deal: "Son of David, have mercy on me." 49 And Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man, saying to him, "Be of good comfort. Rise. He calls you." 50 And casting away his garment, he rose and came to Jesus. 51 And Jesus answered and said to him, "[.woc]#What do you wish that I should do to you?#" The blind man said to him, "Lord, that I may receive my sight." 52 And Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Go, your faith has made you whole.#" And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the way.

_Christ rides with triumph into Jerusalem, 1-11; curses the fruitless fig-tree, 12-14; purges the temple, 15-19; exhorts his disciples to steadfastness of faith and to forgive their enemies, 20-26; and defends the lawfulness of his actions by the witness of John, who was a man sent by God, 27-33._

1 And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples, 2 And says to them, "[.woc]#Go into the village over against you. And as soon as you have entered into it, you shall find a colt tied, on which never a man sat. Untie him and bring him.# 3 [.woc]#And if any man says to you, 'Why do you do this?' say that the Lord has need of him, and immediately he will send him here.#" 4 And they went and found the colt tied by the door outside in a place where two ways met, and they untied him. 5 And some of those who stood there, said to them, "What are you doing untying the colt?" 6 And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded, and they let them go. 7 And they brought the colt to Jesus and cast their garments on him, and he sat upon him. 8 And many spread their garments in the way, and others cut down branches off trees and spread them in the way. [[mrk011-009]]9 And those who went before and those who followed cried, saying,

11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple. And when he had looked around at all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.

12 And on the next day, when they had come from Bethany, he was hungry, 13 And seeing a fig-tree afar off having leaves, he came, if perhaps he might find anything on it. And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for the time of figs had not yet come. 14 And Jesus answered and said to it, "[.woc]#Let no man eat fruit from you hereafter forever.#" And his disciples heard it.

15 And they came to Jerusalem. And Jesus went into the temple and began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves, 16 And would not allow any man to carry any vessel through the temple. [[mrk011-017]]17 And he taught, saying to them, "[.woc]#Is it not written, '_My house shall be called by all nations the house of prayer_'? But you have made it '_a den of thieves._'#" 18 And the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him, for they feared him, because all the people were astonished at his doctrine.

19 And when evening had come, he went out of the city.

20 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots. 21 And Peter calling to remembrance, says to him, "Master, behold, the fig-tree which you cursed has withered." 22 And Jesus answering, says to them, "[.woc]#Have faith in God.# 23 [.woc]#For truly I say to you, that whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that the things which he says shall come to pass, he shall have whatever he says.# 24 [.woc]#Therefore, I say to you, whatever things you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them and you shall have them.# 25 [.woc]#And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven may also forgive you of your trespasses.# 26 [.woc]#But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.#"

27 And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders, 28 And say to him, "By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority to do these things?" 29 And Jesus answered and said to them, "[.woc]#I will also ask of you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.# 30 [.woc]#The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.#" 31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' 32 But if we say, 'From men'—" They feared the people, for all men counted John that he was a prophet indeed. 33 And they answered and said to Jesus, "We cannot tell." And Jesus answering says to them, "[.woc]#Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.#"

=== Chapter 12

[.outline.text-center]
_In a parable of the vineyard lent out to wicked farmers, Christ foretells the reprobation of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles, 1-12. He avoids the snare of the Pharisees and Herodians about paying tribute to Caesar, 13-17; convicts the Sadducees of error, who denied the resurrection, 18-27; resolves the scribe who questioned of the first commandment, 28-34; refutes the opinion that the scribes held of Christ, 35-37; bidding the people to beware of their ambition and hypocrisy, 38-40; and commends the poor widow above all for her two mites, 41-44._

1 And he began to speak to them in parables. "[.woc]#A certain man planted a vineyard, set a hedge around it, dug a place for the wine-vat, built a tower, lent it out to farmers, and went into a far country.# 2 [.woc]#And at the season, he sent to the farmers a servant so that he might receive from the farmers some of the fruit of the vineyard.# 3 [.woc]#And they caught him, beat him, and sent him away empty.# 4 [.woc]#And again, he sent to them another servant, and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled.# 5 [.woc]#And again he sent another, and they killed him, and many others, beating some and killing some.# 6 [.woc]#Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent him last to them, saying, 'They will reverence my son.'# 7 [.woc]#But those farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours.'# 8 [.woc]#And they took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.# 9 [.woc]#What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers and will give the vineyard to others.# [[mrk012-010]]10 [.woc]#And have you not read this Scripture:#

12 And they sought to lay hold upon him, but feared the people, for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them. And they left him and departed.

13 And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to catch him in his words. 14 And when they had come, they say to him, "Master, we know that you are true and care for no man, for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 15 Shall we give, or shall we not give?" But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "[.woc]#Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius so that I may see it.#" 16 And they brought it, and he says to them, "[.woc]#Whose image and superscription is this?#" And they said to him, "Caesar's." 17 And Jesus answering, said to them, "[.woc]#Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.#" And they wondered at him.

18 Then the Sadducees came to him, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him, saying, [[mrk012-019]]19 "Master, Moses wrote to us, '_If a man's brother dies and leaves his wife and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise children for his brother._' 20 Now there were seven brothers: the first took a wife, and dying left no children; 21 And the second took her and died, neither did he leave any children; and the third likewise; 22 And the seven had her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died. 23 In the resurrection therefore, when they rise, whose wife shall she be of them? For the seven had her for a wife." 24 And Jesus answering, said to them, "[.woc]#Do you not therefore err because you do not know the Scriptures, neither the power of God?# 25 [.woc]#For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels who are in heaven.# [[mrk012-026]]26 [.woc]#And concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying, '_I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob_'?# 27 [.woc]#He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You therefore greatly err.#"

28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, "Which is the first commandment of all?" [[mrk012-029]]29 And Jesus answered him, "[.woc]#The first of all the commandments is, '_Hear, O Israel. The Lord our God is one Lord._# [[mrk012-030]]30 [.woc]#_And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength._' This is the first commandment.# [[mrk012-031]]31 [.woc]#And the second is like it, namely this: '_You shall love your neighbor as yourself._' There is no other commandment greater than these.#" [[mrk012-032]]32 And the scribe said to him, "Right, Master, you have said the truth, for there '_is one God,_' '_and there is no other but he._' 33 And to love him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices." 34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said to him, "[.woc]#You are not far from the kingdom of God.#" And no man after that dared to question him.

35 And while he taught in the temple, Jesus answered and said, "[.woc]#How is it that the scribes say that Christ is the son of David?# [[mrk012-036]]36 [.woc]#For David himself said by the Holy Spirit,#

37 [.woc]#Therefore, David himself calls him Lord, and how is he then his son?#" And the common people heard him gladly.

38 And he said to them in his doctrine, "[.woc]#Beware of the scribes who love to go in long clothing, love salutations in the market-places,# 39 [.woc]#The chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts,# 40 [.woc]#Who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater condemnation.#"

41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury. And many who were rich cast in much. 42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a quadrans. 43 And he called his disciples and says to them, "[.woc]#Truly I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all those who have cast into the treasury.# 44 [.woc]#For they all cast in of their abundance, but she of her lack cast in all that she had, even all her living.#"

=== Chapter 13

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ foretells the destruction of the temple, 1-8; the persecutions for the gospel, 9; that the gospel must be preached to all nations, 10-13; that great calamities shall happen to the Jews, 14-23; and the manner of his coming to judgment, 24-31; the hour of which being known to no one, every man is to watch and pray so that we are not found unprovided when he comes to each one particularly by death, 32-37._

1 And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, "Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!" 2 And Jesus answering said to him, "[.woc]#Do you see these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.#"

3 And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, over against the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, 4 "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things are fulfilled?" 5 And Jesus answering them, began to say, "[.woc]#Take heed lest any man deceive you.# 6 [.woc]#For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am Christ,' and will deceive many.# 7 [.woc]#And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled, for such things must come. But the end is not yet.# 8 [.woc]#For nation will rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in diverse places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginnings of sorrows.#

9 "[.woc]#But take heed to yourselves. For they will deliver you up to councils, and in the synagogues you will be beaten, and you will be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them.# 10 [.woc]#And the gospel must first be published among all nations.# 11 [.woc]#But when they lead you and deliver you up, do not be anxious beforehand of what you shall speak, neither premeditate. But whatever is given to you in that hour, speak it, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.# 12 [.woc]#Now the brother will betray the brother to death, and the father the son. And children will rise up against their parents and will cause them to be put to death.# 13 [.woc]#And you will be hated by all men for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end, the same shall be saved.#

[[mrk013-014]]14 "[.woc]#But when you see '_the abomination of desolation_' spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not (let him who reads understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.# 15 [.woc]#And he who is on the house-top must not go down into the house, neither enter it, to take anything out of his house.# 16 [.woc]#And he who is in the field must not turn back again to take up his garment.# 17 [.woc]#But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse infants in those days.# 18 [.woc]#And pray that your flight is not in the winter.# 19 [.woc]#For in those days there shall be affliction such as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time, neither shall there be.# 20 [.woc]#And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved. But for the elect's sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days.# 21 [.woc]#And then, if any man says to you, 'Behold, here is Christ,' or, 'Behold, he is there,' do not believe him.# 22 [.woc]#For false Christs and false prophets will rise and will show signs and wonders to lead astray, if it were possible, even the elect.# 23 [.woc]#But take heed. Behold, I have foretold you all things.#

[[mrk013-024]]24 "[.woc]#But in those days, after that tribulation, '_the sun shall be darkened, the moon shall not give her light,_# [[mrk013-025]]25 [.woc]#_The stars of heaven shall fall,_' and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.# [[mrk013-026]]26 [.woc]#And then they shall see '_the Son of man coming in the clouds_' with great power and glory.# [[mrk013-027]]27 [.woc]#And then he will send his angels and will assemble his elect from the four winds, '_from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven._'#

28 "[.woc]#Now learn a parable of the fig-tree: when its branch is yet tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.# 29 [.woc]#Thus you, in a like manner, when you see these things come to pass, know that it is near, even at the doors.# 30 [.woc]#Truly I say to you, that this generation shall not pass until all these things are done.# 31 [.woc]#Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.# 32 [.woc]#But of that day and that hour no man knows, not even the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.#

33 "[.woc]#Take heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time is.# 34 [.woc]#For the Son of man is like a man taking a long journey, who left his house and gave authority to his servants, each to his work, and commanded the gatekeeper to watch.# 35 [.woc]#Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house comes—at evening, at midnight, at the cock-crowing, or in the morning—# 36 [.woc]#Lest coming suddenly, he should find you sleeping.# 37 [.woc]#And what I say to you, I say to all: 'Watch.'#"

=== Chapter 14

[.outline.text-center]
_A conspiracy against Christ, 1, 2. Precious ointment is poured on his head by a woman, 3-9. Judas sells his Master for money, 10, 11. Christ himself foretells how he shall be betrayed by one of his disciples, 12-21; after the passover is prepared and eaten, institutes his last supper, 22-25; declares beforehand the flight of all his disciples and Peter's denial, 26-42. Judas betrays him with a kiss, 43-45. He is apprehended in the garden, 46-52; falsely accused and impiously condemned by the Jews' council, 53-64; shamefully abused by them, 65; and three times denied by Peter, 66-72._

1 After two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavened bread. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put him to death. 2 But they said, "Not on the feast-day, lest there should be an uproar of the people."

3 And being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, there came a woman having an alabaster vial of ointment of spikenard, very precious, and she broke the vial and poured it on his head. 4 And there were some who had indignation within themselves, and said, "Why was this waste of the ointment made? 5 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor." And they murmured against her. 6 And Jesus said, "[.woc]#Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has wrought a good work on me.# 7 [.woc]#For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish, you may do them good. But you do not always have me.# 8 [.woc]#She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint my body for the burial.# 9 [.woc]#Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the whole world, this also that she has done shall be spoken of for a memorial to her.#"

10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them. 11 And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him, "Where do you wish that we go and prepare so that you may eat the passover?" 13 And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, "[.woc]#Go into the city, and there a man shall meet you bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him.# 14 [.woc]#And wherever he goes in, say to the master of the house, 'The Master says, "Where is the guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?"'# 15 [.woc]#And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared. Make ready for us there.#" 16 And his disciples went and came into the city and found it as he had said to them. And they made ready the passover.

17 And in the evening, he comes with the twelve. 18 And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, "[.woc]#Truly I say to you, one of you who eats with me will betray me.#" 19 And they began to be sorrowful and to say to him one by one, "Is it I?" And another said, "Is it I?" 20 And he answered and said to them, "[.woc]#It is one of the twelve who dips with me in the dish.# 21 [.woc]#The Son of man indeed goes, as it is written concerning him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.#"

22 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, "[.woc]#Take, eat. This is my body.#" 23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. 24 And he said to them, "[.woc]#This is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many.# 25 [.woc]#Truly I say to you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until the day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.#"

26 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. [[mrk014-027]]27 And Jesus says to them, "[.woc]#All of you will be offended because of me this night, for it is written, 'I will "_smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered._"'# 28 [.woc]#But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.#" 29 But Peter said to him, "Even though all shall be offended, yet I will not." 30 And Jesus says to him, "[.woc]#Truly I say to you, that this day, even in this night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.#" 31 But he spoke the more vehemently, "If I should die with you, I will not deny you in any way." They all also said likewise.

32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane. And he says to his disciples, "[.woc]#Sit here while I pray.#" 33 And he takes with him Peter, James, and John and began to be greatly amazed and to be very heavy, 34 And says to them, "[.woc]#My soul is exceedingly sorrowful to death. Remain here and watch.#" 35 And he went forward a little, fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. 36 And he said, "[.woc]#Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Take away this cup from me. Nevertheless, not what I will, but what you will.#" 37 And he comes and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, "[.woc]#Simon, do you sleep? Could you not watch one hour?# 38 [.woc]#Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.#" 39 And again he went away, prayed, and spoke the same words. 40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again (for their eyes were heavy), neither did they know what to answer him. 41 And he comes the third time, and says to them, "[.woc]#Sleep on now and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.# 42 [.woc]#Rise, let us go. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.#"

43 And immediately while he was yet speaking, Judas comes, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. 44 And he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss, he is the one. Take him and lead him away safely." 45 And as soon as he had come, he goes immediately to him, and says, "Master, master," and kissed him. 46 And they laid their hands on him and took him. 47 And one of those who stood by drew a sword, smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 48 And Jesus answered and said to them, "[.woc]#Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and with staffs to take me?# 49 [.woc]#I was with you daily in the temple teaching, and you did not take me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.#" 50 And they all forsook him and fled.

51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast around his naked body, and the young men laid hold upon him. 52 And he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.

53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest. And with him all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes were assembled. 54 And Peter followed him at a distance, even into the palace of the high priest, and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire. 55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus to put him to death, and found none. 56 For many bore false testimony against him, but their testimony did not agree together. 57 And some rose up and bore false testimony against him, saying, 58 "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.'" 59 But neither in this way did their testimony agree together. 60 And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, saying, "Do you answer nothing? What is it which these testify against you?" 61 But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?" [[mrk014-062]]62 And Jesus said, "[.woc]#I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and '_coming in the clouds of heaven._'#" 63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and says, "What need do we have of any further witnesses? 64 You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. 65 And some began to spit on him, to cover his face, to buffet him, and to say to him, "Prophesy." And the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.

66 And as Peter was below in the palace, there comes one of the women-servants of the high priest. 67 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, "And you were also with Jesus of Nazareth." 68 But he denied, saying, "I do not know, neither do I understand what you say." And he went out into the porch and the cock crowed. 69 And a woman-servant saw him again and began to say to those who stood by, "This is one of them." 70 And he denied it again. And a little after, those who stood by said again to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech agrees thereto." 71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, "I do not know this man of whom you speak." 72 And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said to him: "Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times." And when he thought thereon, he wept.

1 And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders, scribes, and the whole council, and bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. 2 And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he, answering, said to him, "[.woc]#You say it.#" 3 And the chief priests accused him of many things, but he answered nothing. 4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, "Do you answer nothing? Behold how many things they testify against you." 5 But Jesus still answered nothing; therefore, Pilate marveled.

6 Now at that feast he released to them one prisoner whom they desired. 7 And there was one named Barabbas, who lay bound with those who had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. 8 And the multitude crying aloud, began to desire him to do as he had always done for them. 9 But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you wish that I release to you the King of the Jews?" 10 (For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.) 11 But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas to them. 12 And Pilate answered and said again to them, "What do you wish then that I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?" 13 And they cried out again, "Crucify him." 14 Then Pilate said to them, "Why? What evil has he done?" And they cried out the more exceedingly, "Crucify him." 15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.

16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they called together the whole band. 17 And they clothed him with purple, platted a crown of thorns, put it around his head, 18 And began to salute him: "Hail, King of the Jews!" 19 And they struck him on the head with a reed, spit upon him, and bowing their knees, worshiped him. 20 And when they had mocked him, they took the purple from off of him, put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

21 And they constrained someone who was passing by, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), who was coming from the country, to bear his cross.

22 And they bring him to the place Golgotha (which is, being interpreted, The Place of a Skull). 23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, but he did not receive it. 24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. 25 And it was the third hour and they crucified him. 26 And the superscription of his accusation was written above, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."

27 And with him they crucified two thieves: one on his right hand and the other on his left. [[mrk015-028]]28 And the Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "_And he was numbered with the transgressors._" 29 And those who passed by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ah, you who destroy the temple and build it in three days, 30 Save yourself and come down from the cross." 31 Likewise, the chief priests, also mocking, said among themselves with the scribes, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself. 32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross so that we may see and believe." And those who were crucified with him reviled him.

33 And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. [[mrk015-034]]34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "[.woc]#_Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?_#" (which is, being interpreted, "_My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?_") 35 And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold, he calls Elijah." 36 And someone ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait. Let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down." 37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice and expired. 38 And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom. 39 And when the centurion who stood over against him saw that he thus cried out and expired, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God."

40 There were also women looking on at a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James the younger and Joseph), Salome 41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered to him), and many other women who came with him to Jerusalem.

42 And now, when the evening had come, because it was the preparation (that is, the day before the sabbath), 43 Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and petitioned for the body of Jesus. 44 And Pilate marveled that he was already dead. And calling the centurion, he asked him whether he had already been dead. 45 And when he knew it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 46 And he bought fine linen, took him down, wrapped him in the linen, laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher. 47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph beheld where he was laid.

=== Chapter 16

[.outline.text-center]
_An angel declares the resurrection of Christ to three women, 1-8. Christ himself appears to Mary Magdalene, 9-11; to two going into the country, 12, 13; then to the apostles, 14; whom he sends forth to preach the gospel, 15-18; and ascends into heaven, 19, 20._

1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James), and Salome had bought sweet spices so that they might come and anoint him. 2 And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came to the sepulcher at the rising of the sun. 3 And they said among themselves, "Who shall roll away the stone from the door of the sepulcher for us?" 4 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away—for it was very large. 5 And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment, and they were frightened. 6 And he says to them, "Do not be frightened. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold the place where they laid him. 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He goes before you into Galilee. There you shall see him, as he said to you.'" 8 And they went out quickly and fled from the sepulcher, for they trembled and were amazed. They did not say anything to any man, for they were afraid.

9 Now when Jesus had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons. 10 And she went and told those who had been with him as they mourned and wept. 11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe.

12 After that, he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking and going into the country. 13 And they went and told it to the rest, but they did not believe them.

14 Afterward, he appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table and rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they did not believe those who had seen him after he was risen. [[mrk016-015]]15 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.# 16 [.woc]#He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.# 17 [.woc]#And these signs shall follow those who believe: in my name they shall cast out demons, they shall speak in new languages,# 18 [.woc]#They shall take up serpents, if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them, and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.#"

19 So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God. 20 And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
