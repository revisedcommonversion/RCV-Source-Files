=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_After his salutation and thanksgiving, 1-9, Paul exhorts them to unity, 10, 11, and reproves their dissensions, 12-17. God destroys the wisdom of the wise, 18-20, by the foolishness of preaching, 21-25; and does not call the wise, mighty, and noble, 26, 27, but the foolish, weak, and men of no account, 28-31._

1 Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

2 To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord—both theirs and ours:

3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

4 I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given to you by Jesus Christ, 5 That in everything you are enriched by him, in all utterance and in all knowledge, 6 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you, 7 So that you are not lacking in any gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, 8 Who will also confirm you to the end so that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

10 Now I implore you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. 11 For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. 12 Now this I say, that each of you says, "I am of Paul," "I of Apollos," "I of Cephas," and, "I of Christ." 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? 14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15 Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name. 16 And I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides them, I do not know whether I baptized any other. 17 For Christ has not sent me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.

18 For the preaching of the cross is foolishness to those who perish. But to us who are saved, it is the power of God. [[fco001-019]]19 For it is written,

|"_I will destroy the wisdom of the wise_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent._"
|===

20 Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Has God not made the wisdom of this world foolish? 21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom did not know God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe. 22 For the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek wisdom, 23 But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block and to the Greeks foolishness, 24 But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

26 For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called. 27 But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, 28 And God has chosen the base things of the world, the things which are despised, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, 29 So that no flesh should glory in his presence. 30 But because of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God—our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption— [[fco001-031]]31 So that, according as it is written, "_He who glories, let him glory in the Lord._"

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul declares that his preaching, though it is not with excellency of speech, or of human wisdom, yet consists in the power of God, 1-5; and so far excels the wisdom of this world and human sense that the natural man cannot understand it, 6-16._

1 And when I came to you, brothers, I did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God. 2 For I determined to not know anything among you, except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 3 And I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling. 4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 5 So that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

6 However, we do speak wisdom among those who are mature, but not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world, which are coming to nothing. 7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the ages to our glory, 8 Which none of the princes of this age knew. For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. [[fco002-009]]9 But as it is written,

10 But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 11 For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of man which is in him? Even so, the things of God no man knows except the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God so that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God, 13 Which things we also speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

14 But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged by no man. [[fco002-016]]16 "_For who has known the mind of the Lord so that he may instruct him?_" But we have the mind of Christ.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Milk is fit for children, 1, 2. Strife and division, arguments of a fleshly mind, 3-6. He who plants and he who waters are nothing, 7, 8. The ministers are God's fellow workers, 9, 10. Christ is the only foundation, 11-15. Men are the temples of God, which must be kept holy, 16-18. The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, 19-23._

1 And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babies in Christ. 2 I have fed you with milk and not with solid food. For until now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able, 3 Because you are still carnal. For whereas there is among you envying, strife, and divisions, are you not carnal and walk as men? 4 For while one says, "I am of Paul," and another, "I am of Apollos," are you not carnal?

5 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? 6 I have planted, Apollos watered, but God has given the increase. 7 So then, neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but God who gives the increase. 8 Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. 9 For we are laborers together with God. You are God's farming. You are God's building.

10 According to the grace of God which is given to me, I have laid the foundation like a wise master-builder, and another builds upon it. But let every man take heed how he builds upon it. 11 For no man can lay any other foundation than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12 Now if any man builds upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or stubble, 13 Every man's work will be made manifest. For the day will declare it because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will try every man's work, of what sort it is. 14 If any man's work abides which he has built upon it, he shall receive a reward. 15 If any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, but in the manner as by fire.

16 Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? 17 If any man defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.

18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool so that he may be wise. [[fco003-019]]19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "_He takes the wise in their own craftiness,_" [[fco003-020]]20 And again, "_The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain._" 21 Therefore, let no man glory in men. For all things are yours, 22 Whether Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, things present, or things to come. All are yours, 23 And you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.

[.outline.text-center]
_Judgments, human and Divine, respecting ministers, 1-5. Contrast between the inflated self sufficiency of the Corinthians and the earthly humiliation of the apostles, 6-13. The practical steps which Paul intends to take with reference to these party divisions, 14-21._

1 Let a man regard us in this way: as the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. 2 Moreover, it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful. 3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by man's judgment. Indeed, I do not judge my own self. 4 For I know nothing against myself, yet I am not hereby justified. But he who judges me is the Lord. 5 Therefore, judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then every man shall have praise from God.

6 And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes so that you may learn in us not to think of men above that which is written. This is so that none of you on account of one may be puffed up against another. 7 For who makes you to differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you received it, why do you glory as if you had not received it?

8 Now you are full. Now you are rich. You have reigned as kings without us. And I wish you reigned so that we also might reign with you. 9 For I think that God has set forth us, the apostles, last, like men appointed to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men. 10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honorable, but we are despised. 11 Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place. 12 And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless. Being persecuted, we suffer it. 13 Being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things to this day.

14 I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you. [[fco004-015]]15 For though you have ten thousand school-masters in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. 16 Therefore, I implore you, be followers of me. 17 For this cause I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord, who will bring you into remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church. 18 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. 19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing, and will know, not the speech of those who are puffed up, but the power. 20 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. 21 What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and in the spirit of meekness?

[.outline.text-center]
_The incestuous person, 1-5, is cause rather of shame to them than of rejoicing, 6. The old leaven is to be purged out, 7-9. Heinous offenders are to be shamed and avoided, 10-13._

1 It is reported commonly that there is lewdness among you, and such lewdness as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. 2 And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned so that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you.

3 For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged concerning him who has thus done this deed. 4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are assembled with my spirit and with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 5 Deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? 7 Therefore, cleanse out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us. 8 Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

9 I have written to you in this epistle not to associate with persons guilty of lewdness— 10 Yet not altogether with lewd persons of this world, or with the covetous, extortioners, or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world. 11 But now I have written to you not to keep company with any man who is called a brother if he is a lewd person, covetous, an idolater, a railer, a drunkard, or an extortioner. Do not even eat with such a person. 12 For what have I to do to judge those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside? [[fco005-013]]13 But those who are outside God judges. "_Therefore, put away from among yourselves that wicked person._"

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_The Corinthians must not vex their brothers in going to law with them, 1-5; especially under unbelievers, 6-8. The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God, 9-14. Our bodies are the members of Christ and temples of the Holy Spirit; therefore, they must not be defiled, 15-20._

1 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust and not before the saints? 2 Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more things that pertain to this life? 4 If then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. 5 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? Not even one who will be able to judge between his brothers? 6 But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.

7 Now therefore, there is utterly a fault among you because you go to law with one another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather allow yourselves to be defrauded? 8 But you do wrong and defraud, and that to your brothers.

[[fco006-009]]9 Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, abusers of themselves with mankind, 10 Thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you. But you are washed, you are sanctified, you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.

12 "All things are lawful to me," but all things are not expedient. "All things are lawful for me," but I will not be brought under the power of any. 13 "Foods for the belly and the belly for foods," but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for lewdness, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 14 And God has both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by his own power. 15 Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? By no means. [[fco006-016]]16 Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? For he says, "_The two shall be one flesh._" 17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. 18 Flee lewdness. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits lewdness sins against his own body. 19 Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God, and you are not your own? 20 For you are bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.

=== Chapter 7

[.outline.text-center]
_Paul discusses marriage, 1-3; showing it to be a remedy against fornication, 4-9, and that the bond thereof ought not lightly to be dissolved, 10-19. Every man must be content with his vocation, 20-24. Virginity therefore to be embraced, 25-34; and for what respects we may either marry or abstain from marrying, 35-40._

1 Now concerning the things of which you wrote to me, it is good for a man not to touch a woman. 2 Nevertheless, to avoid lewdness, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. 3 Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence, and likewise also the wife to the husband. 4 The wife does not have power over her own body, but the husband does, and likewise also, the husband does not have power over his own body, but the wife does. 5 Do not deprive one another, except with consent for a time, so that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. And come together again so that Satan may not tempt you for your incontinence. 6 But I speak this by permission and not as a commandment. 7 For I wish that all men were as I myself. But every man has his proper gift from God, one after this manner and another after that.

8 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I am. 9 But if they cannot contain, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn.

10 And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, do not let the wife depart from her husband. 11 But if she departs, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband, and do not let the husband put away his wife.

12 But to the rest I speak, not the Lord, if any brother has a wife who does not believe and she is pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. 13 And if a woman has a husband who does not believe and he is pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. 14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. 15 But if the unbelieving departs, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace. 16 For how do you know, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? Or how do you know, O man, whether you shall save your wife?

17 But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And thus I ordain in all churches. 18 Is any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? Let him not become circumcised. 19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God, [that is something]. 20 Let every man continue in the same calling in which he was called.

21 Are you called being a servant? Do not care for it, but if you may be made free, use it rather. 22 For he who is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's free man. Likewise also, he who is called, being free, is Christ's servant. 23 You are bought with a price. Do not be the servants of men. 24 Brothers, let every man in the state in which he is called continue in it with God.

25 Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord. Yet I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful. 26 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man to be so. 27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 28 But if you marry, you have not sinned, and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless, such will have trouble in the flesh, but I spare you. 29 But I say this, brothers, the time is short, so that from now on, those who have wives may be as though they had none, 30 And those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess, 31 And those who use this world as not abusing it. For the fashion of this world passes away.

32 But I wish to have you without anxious care. He who is unmarried is anxious for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord. 33 But he who is married is anxious for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. 34 There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman is anxious for the things of the Lord so that she may be holy, both in body and in spirit. But she who is married is anxious for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 35 And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is proper and so that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction.

36 But if any man thinks that he behaves himself improperly toward his virgin, if she has passed the flower of her age, and need so requires, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin. Let them marry. 37 Nevertheless, he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will and has thus decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well. 38 So then he who gives her in marriage does well, but he who does not give her in marriage does better.

39 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives. But if her husband is dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. 40 But she is happier if she remains so, according to my judgment—and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.

=== Chapter 8

[.outline.text-center]
_To abstain from foods offered to idols, 1-7. We must not abuse our Christian liberty to the offense of our brothers, 8-10; but must bridle our knowledge with charity, 11-13._

1 Now as concerning things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies. 2 And if any man thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know. 3 But if any man loves God, the same is known by him.

4 Therefore, as concerning the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no other God but one. 5 For though there are things that are called gods, whether in heaven or upon earth (as there are many gods and many lords), 6 Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we in him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.

7 But that knowledge is not in every man. For some, with consciousness of the idol to this hour, eat it as a thing offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 8 But food does not commend us to God. For neither are we the better if we eat, neither are we the worse if we do not eat. 9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours should become a stumbling-block to those who are weak. 10 For if any man sees you, who have knowledge, eating in the idol's temple, will the conscience of him who is weak not be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols? 11 And through your knowledge, shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? 12 But when you thus sin against the brothers and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 13 Therefore, if food makes my brother to fall into sin, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to fall into sin.

_Paul shows his liberty, 1-6; and that the minister ought to live by the Gospel, 7-14; yet that he has of his own accord abstained, 15-17, to be either chargeable to them, 18-21, or offensive to any, in matters indifferent, 22, 23. Our life is compared to a race, 24-27._

1 Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 2 If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.

3 My answer to those who examine me is this: 4 Do we not have power to eat and to drink? 5 Do we not have the right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas? 6 Or I only and Barnabas, do we not have the right to forbear working? 7 Who goes to warfare at any time at his own charges? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who feeds a flock and does not drink the milk of the flock?

8 Do I say these things as a man? Or does the law not say the same also? [[fco009-009]]9 For it is written in the law of Moses, "_You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the grain._" Is it for the oxen that God cares, 10 Or does he say this altogether for our sakes? For our sakes no doubt this is written, so that he who plows should plow in hope, and that he who threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope. 11 If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things? 12 If others are partakers of this power over you, are we not rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power, but bear all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 13 Do you not know that those who minister about holy things live from the things of the temple, and those who wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? 14 Likewise also, the Lord has ordained that those who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.

15 But I have used none of these things, neither have I written these things, so that it should be thus done to me. For it would be better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void. 16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me. And woe is to me if I do not preach the gospel! 17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward, but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me. 18 What is my reward then? Truly that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my power in the gospel.

19 For though I am free from all men, yet I have made myself servant to all so that I might gain the more. 20 And to the Jews I became as a Jew so that I might gain the Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, so that I might gain those who are under the law; 21 To those who are without law, as without law (not being without law to God, but under the law to Christ), so that I might gain those who are without law; 22 To the weak I became as weak so that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men so that I might by all means save some. 23 And this I do for the gospel's sake so that I may be partaker of it with you.

24 Do you not know, that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Likewise run so that you may obtain. 25 And every man who strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. 26 I therefore run in that way, not as uncertainly. I fight in that way, not as one who beats the air. 27 But I buffet my body and bring it into subjection, lest by any means when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away.

_The sacraments of the Jews are types of ours, 1-6; and their punishments, 7-10, examples for us, 11-13. We must flee from idolatry, 14-20. We must not make the Lord's table the table of devils, 21-23; and in things indifferent we must have regard for our brothers, 24-33._

1 Moreover, brothers, I do not wish that you should be ignorant, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, 2 And were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea, 3 And all ate the same spiritual food, 4 And all drank the same spiritual drink (for they drank of that spiritual Rock which followed them, and that Rock was Christ). [[fco010-005]]5 But with many of them God was not well pleased, "_for they were overthrown in the wilderness._"

6 Now these things were our examples so that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted, [[fco010-007]]7 Neither be idolaters as some of them were, as it is written, "_The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play._" 8 Neither let us commit lewdness as some of them committed, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day. 9 Let us not test Christ as some of them also tested and were destroyed by serpents. 10 Let us not murmur as some of them also murmured and were destroyed by the destroyer. 11 Now all these things happened to them for examples. And they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come. 12 Therefore, let him who thinks he stands take heed, lest he fall. 13 There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape so that you may be able to bear it.

14 Therefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. 15 I speak as to wise men. Judge what I say. 16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? 17 For we, being many, are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread. 18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are those who eat the sacrifices not partakers of the altar? 19 What then do I say? That the idol is anything, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything? [[fco010-020]]20 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, "_they sacrifice to demons and not to God,_" and I do not wish that you should have fellowship with demons. 21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of demons. 22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he is?

23 "All things are lawful for me," but all things are not expedient. "All things are lawful for me," but all things do not edify. 24 Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth. 25 Whatever is sold in the provision market, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake. [[fco010-026]]26 For "_the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness._" 27 If any of those who do not believe invites you to a feast and you are disposed to go, whatever is set before you, eat, asking no question on account of conscience. [[fco010-028]]28 But if any man says to you, "This is offered in sacrifice to idols," do not eat for his sake who showed it and for the sake of conscience. For "_the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness._" 29 Conscience, I say, not your own, but of the other. For why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience? 30 For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?

31 Whether therefore you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 32 Give no offense, neither to the Jews, to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God, 33 Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, so that they may be saved.

_Paul reproves them, because in holy assemblies, 1-3, their men prayed with their heads covered, 4, 5, and women with their heads uncovered, 6-16; and because generally their meetings were not for the better, but for the worse, 17-20; as, namely, in profaning with their own feasts the Lord's supper, 21-24. Lastly, he calls them to the first institution thereof, 25-34._

1 Be followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

2 Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you. 3 But I wish to have you know, that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. 4 Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered dishonors his head. 5 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is even one and the same as if she were shaved. 6 For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn, but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered. 7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. 8 For the man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man, 9 Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man. 10 For this cause, the woman ought to have [a token of] authority on her head, because of the angels. 11 Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord. 12 For as the woman is from the man, even so is the man also by the woman, but all things from God. 13 Judge for yourselves. Is it proper that a woman should pray to God uncovered? 14 Does even nature itself not teach you, that if a man has long hair, it is a shame to him? 15 But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering. 16 But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do the churches of God.

17 Now in this that I declare to you I do not praise you, that you do not come together for the better, but for the worse. 18 For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it. 19 For there must also be sects among you so that those who are approved may be made manifest among you. 20 When therefore you come together in one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. 21 For in eating, each one takes before another his own supper. And one is hungry and another is drunken. 22 What? Do you not have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who do not have? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.

23 For I have received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. 24 And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me." 25 After the same manner, he also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me." 26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes.

27 Therefore, whoever eats this bread and drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man examine himself, and in this manner let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. 29 For he who eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 30 For this cause, many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. 31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. 32 But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord so that we should not be condemned with the world.

33 Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. 34 And if any man hungers, let him eat at home so that you do not come together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.

_Spiritual gifts, 1-3, are diverse, 4-6, yet given to every man for profit, 7. And to that end are diversely bestowed, 8-11; so that by similar proportion, as the members of a natural body tend all to the mutual decency, 12-21, service, 22-25, and support of the same body, 26; we should also do for one another, to make up the body of Christ, 27-31._

1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I wish to not have you ignorant. 2 You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these mute idols, even as you were led. 3 Therefore, I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.

4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. 6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who works all in all. 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for profit. 8 For by the Spirit the word of wisdom is given to one; to another, the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 9 To another, faith by the same Spirit; to another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 10 To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of languages; to another, the interpretation of languages. 11 But the one and the same Spirit works all these, dividing to every man separately as he wills.

12 For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free, and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.

14 For the body is not one member, but many. 15 If the foot says, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body? 16 And if the ear says, "Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body? 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be? 18 But now God has set each of the members in the body as it has pleased him. 19 And if they were all one member, where would the body be? 20 But now they are many members, but one body. 21 And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you." 22 Contrarily, much rather those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary, 23 And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor. And our unpresentable parts have more abundant modesty, 24 But our presentable parts have no need. But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked, 25 So that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another. 26 And thus if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it, or, if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.

27 Now you are the body of Christ and members in particular. 28 And God has set some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, next miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and diversities of languages. 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? 30 Do all have the gifts of healing? Do all speak in languages? Do all interpret? 31 But earnestly covet the best gifts. And yet I show to you a more excellent way.

_All gifts, 1, 2, however excellent, are worth nothing without charity, 3. The praises thereof, 4-12, and preferment before hope and faith, 13._

1 If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but do not have charity, I have become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And if I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I could remove mountains, but do not have charity, I am nothing. 3 And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and if I give my body to be burned, but do not have charity, it profits me nothing.

4 Charity is patient and is kind. Charity does not envy. Charity does not vaunt itself, is not puffed up, 5 Does not behave itself unseemly, does not seek its own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil, 6 Does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth, 7 Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

8 Charity never fails. But if there are prophecies, they shall fail. If there are languages, they shall cease. If there is knowledge, it shall vanish away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part. 10 But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall be done away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, and I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see through a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know even as I am also known. 13 But now faith, hope, and charity endure—these three. But the greatest of these is charity.

=== Chapter 14

[.outline.text-center]
_Prophecy is commended, 1, and preferred before speaking with languages, 2-5, by a comparison drawn from musical instruments, 6-11. Both must be referred to edification, 12-21, as to their true and proper end, 22-25. The gifts of both languages and prophecy are directed in their use, 26-33. Women are forbidden to speak in the church, 34-40._

1 Follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts, but so much the more that you may prophesy. 2 For he who speaks in an unknown language does not speak to men, but to God, for no man understands him. Yet in the Spirit he speaks mysteries. 3 But he who prophesies speaks to men for edification, exhortation, and comfort. 4 He who speaks in an unknown language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. 5 I wish that you all spoke in languages, but more so that you prophesied. For greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in languages, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edifying.

6 Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in languages, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by doctrine? 7 And even lifeless things giving sound, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? 8 For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle? 9 So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? For you will speak into the air. 10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and not one of them is without signification. 11 Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him who speaks a barbarian, and he who speaks will be a barbarian to me. 12 Even so you, because you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek so that you may excel to the edifying of the church.

13 Therefore, let him who speaks in an unknown language pray that he may interpret. 14 For if I pray in an unknown language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. 15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also. 16 Or else, when you bless with the spirit, how shall he who occupies the room of the unlearned say, "Amen," at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not understand what you say? 17 For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not edified. 18 I thank my God that I speak in languages more than you all. 19 Yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, so that by my voice I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown language.

20 Brothers, do not be children in understanding. Yet in malice be children, but in understanding be mature. [[fco014-021]]21 In the law it is written, "_With men of other languages and other lips I will speak to this people, and yet for all that they will not hear me,_" says the Lord. 22 Therefore, languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to those who do not believe; however, prophesying does not serve for those who do not believe, but for those who believe. 23 If therefore the whole church is assembled in one place and all speak in languages, and there come in those who are unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that you are insane? 24 But if all prophesy, and someone who does not believe or someone unlearned comes in, he is convinced by all and he is judged by all. 25 And thus the secrets of his heart are made manifest, and so falling down on his face, he will worship God and report that God is in you in truth.

26 What is it then, brothers? When you are assembled, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a language, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. 27 If any man speaks in an unknown language, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course, and let someone interpret. 28 But if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in the church and let him speak to himself and to God. 29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge. 30 If anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first hold his peace. 31 For you may all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all may be comforted. 32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.

34 Let your women be silent in the churches. For it is not permitted for them to speak, but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also says the law. 35 And if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. 36 What? Did the word of God come out from you? Or did it come to you only?

37 If any man thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord. 38 But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.

39 Therefore, brothers, covet to prophesy and do not forbid to speak in languages. 40 Let all things be done decently and in order.

=== Chapter 15

[.outline.text-center]
_By Christ's resurrection, 1-11, Paul proves the necessity of our resurrection against all those who deny the resurrection of the body, 12-20. The fruit, 21-34, and the manner thereof, 35-50; and of the changing of those who shall be found alive at the last day, 51-58._

1 Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received and in which you stand, 2 By which you are also saved, if you keep in memory what I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain.

3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 And that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. 6 After that, he was seen by more than five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some have fallen asleep. 7 After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles. 8 And last of all, he was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time. 9 For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God. 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain. But I labored more abundantly than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 11 Therefore, whether it was I or they, that is what we preach and that is what you believed.

12 Now if Christ is preached that he rose from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised. 14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain and your faith is also vain. 15 And indeed we are found false witnesses of God because we have testified concerning God that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise, if in truth the dead do not rise. 16 For if the dead do not rise, then Christ has not been raised. 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain. You are still in your sins. 18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

20 But now Christ has been raised from the dead and has become the first-fruits of those who slept. 21 For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man. 22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. 23 But every man in his own order: Christ the first-fruits, afterward, those who are Christ's at his coming. 24 Then the end comes when he has delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he has put down all rule and all authority and power. 25 For he must reign until he has put all enemies under his feet. 26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. [[fco015-027]]27 For "_he has put all things under his feet._" But when he says, "_All things are put under him,_" it is manifest that he is excepted who put all things under him. 28 And when all things are subdued to him, then the Son himself shall also be subject to him who put all things under him so that God may be all in all.

29 Or else, what will those do who are baptized for the dead if the dead do not rise at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead? 30 And why do we stand in jeopardy every hour? 31 I affirm, by the rejoicing in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. [[fco015-032]]32 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me? If the dead do not rise, "_Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die._" 33 Do not be deceived. "Evil communications corrupt good manners." 34 Awake to righteousness and do not sin, for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.

35 But some man will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what body do they come?" 36 You fool, that which you sow is not vivified unless it dies. 37 And that which you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but bare grain—it may be of wheat or of some other grain. 38 But God gives it a body as it has pleased him, and to every seed its own body. 39 All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fish, and another of birds. 40 There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies, but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another. 41 There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars, for one star differs from another star in glory.

42 Thus also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. 43 It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. 44 It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body. [[fco015-045]]45 And so it is written, "_The first man, Adam, was made a living soul._" The last Adam was made a vivifying spirit. 46 However, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward, that which is spiritual. 47 The first man is from the earth, earthy. The second man is the Lord from heaven. 48 As is the earthy, such are those also who are earthy, and as is the heavenly, such are those also who are heavenly. 49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.

50 Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither does corruption inherit incorruption. 51 Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall sound, the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality. [[fco015-054]]54 So when this corruptible has put on incorruption and this mortal has put on immortality, the saying that is written shall be brought to pass:

56 The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law. 57 But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

_Paul exhorts them to relieve the lack of the brothers at Jerusalem, 1-9. Commends Timothy, 10-12; and after friendly admonitions, 13-15, concludes his epistle with various salutations, 16-24._

1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, you are to do likewise. 2 Upon the first day of the week, let each of you lay by him in store as God has prospered him so that there are no collections when I come. 3 And when I come, whomever you approve by your letters, I will send them to bring your liberality to Jerusalem. 4 And if it is proper that I should also go, they shall go with me.

5 Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia, for I am to pass through Macedonia. 6 And it may be that I shall abide and even winter with you so that you may bring me on my journey wherever I go. 7 For I do not wish to see you merely in passing, but I trust to remain a while with you, if the Lord permits. 8 But I shall remain at Ephesus until Pentecost, 9 For a great and effectual door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.

10 Now if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear, for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do. 11 Let no man therefore despise him. But conduct him forth in peace so that he may come to me, for I expect him with the brothers.

12 As concerning our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers, but his will was not at all to come at this time. But he will come when he has convenient time.

13 Watch, stand firm in the faith, acquit yourselves like men, and be strong. 14 Let all your things be done with charity.

15 I implore you, brothers—you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints— 16 That you submit yourselves to such as these and to everyone who helps with us and labors. 17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for that which was lacking on your part, they have supplied, 18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, acknowledge those who are such.

19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, along with the church that is in their house. 20 All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

21 The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand. 22 If any man does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema, Maran-atha. 23 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 24 May my love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
