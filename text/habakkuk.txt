== The Word of the Lord to Habakkuk

*Habakkuk | Ἀμβακούμ | חבקוק*

[#hab001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_To Habakkuk, indignant at the iniquity of the land, 1-4, is shown the fearful vengeance by the Chaldeans, 5-11. He complains that vengeance should be executed by those who are far worse, 12-17._

1 [_The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw._]

2 O LORD, how long shall I cry [.linebr]#/# +
and you will not hear? [.linebr]#/# +
I even cry out to you of violence, [.linebr]#/# +
and you will not save!

3 Why do you show me iniquity [.linebr]#/# +
and cause me to behold grievance? [.linebr]#/# +
For devastation and violence are before me. [.linebr]#/# +
And there is strife, and contention rises up.

4 Therefore, the law is slackened, [.linebr]#/# +
and judgment never goes forth. [.linebr]#/# +
For the wicked encompasses the righteous; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, perverted justice proceeds.

[[hab001-005]]5 "Behold among the heathen and regard. [.linebr]#/# +
Wonder and be astonished. [.linebr]#/# +
For I will work a work in your days [.linebr]#/# +
which you will not believe though it is told to you.

6 For behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, [.linebr]#/# +
that bitter and hasty nation, [.linebr]#/# +
which shall march through the breadth of the land [.linebr]#/# +
to possess the dwelling-places that are not theirs.

7 They are terrible and dreadful. [.linebr]#/# +
Their judgment and their dignity [.linebr]#/# +
shall proceed from themselves.

8 Their horses are also swifter than the leopards [.linebr]#/# +
and are more fierce than the evening wolves. [.linebr]#/# +
And their horsemen shall spread themselves [.linebr]#/# +
and their horsemen shall come from far. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall fly as the eagle that hastens to devour.

9 They shall all come for violence. [.linebr]#/# +
Their faces shall swallow up the east wind, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.

10 And they shall scoff at the kings, [.linebr]#/# +
and the princes shall be a scorn to them. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall deride every stronghold, [.linebr]#/# +
for they shall heap dust and take it.

11 Then his mind shall change [.linebr]#/# +
and he shall pass over and offend, [.linebr]#/# +
imputing his power to his god."

12 Are you not from everlasting, [.linebr]#/# +
O LORD my God, my Holy One? [.linebr]#/# +
We shall not die. [.linebr]#/# +
O LORD, you have ordained them for judgment. [.linebr]#/# +
And O mighty God, [.linebr]#/# +
you have established them for correction.

13 You are of purer eyes than to behold evil, [.linebr]#/# +
and cannot look at iniquity. [.linebr]#/# +
Why do you look upon those who deal treacherously, [.linebr]#/# +
and keep silence when the wicked devours [.linebr]#/# +
the man who is more righteous than he is?

14 You make men as the fish of the sea, [.linebr]#/# +
as the creeping animals that have no ruler over them.

15 They take up all of them with the hook, [.linebr]#/# +
they catch them in their net [.linebr]#/# +
and gather them in their dragnet; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, they rejoice and are glad.

16 Therefore, they sacrifice to their net [.linebr]#/# +
and burn incense to their dragnet, [.linebr]#/# +
because by them their portion is fat [.linebr]#/# +
and their food plenteous.

17 Shall they therefore empty their net [.linebr]#/# +
and not spare continually to slay the nations?

[#hab002%breakable]
=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_To Habakkuk, waiting for an answer, is shown that he must wait by faith, 1-4. The judgment upon the Chaldean for insatiableness, 5-8, for covetousness, 9-11, for cruelty, 12-14, for drunkenness, 15-17, and for idolatry, 18-20._

1 I will stand upon my watch-post [.linebr]#/# +
and seat myself upon the tower, [.linebr]#/# +
and will watch to see what he will say to me, [.linebr]#/# +
and what I shall answer when I am reproved.

2 And the LORD answered me and said, [.linebr]#/# +
"Write the vision and make it plain upon tablets, [.linebr]#/# +
so that he may run who reads it.

[[hab002-003]]3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, [.linebr]#/# +
but at the end it shall speak, and not lie. [.linebr]#/# +
Though it may linger, wait for it, [.linebr]#/# +
because it will surely come. It will not delay.

[[hab002-004]]4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him, [.linebr]#/# +
but the just shall live by his faith.

5 And also, because he transgresses by wine, [.linebr]#/# +
he is a proud man and does not rest. [.linebr]#/# +
He enlarges his desire as hell, [.linebr]#/# +
and is as death and cannot be satisfied. [.linebr]#/# +
He gathers to himself all nations [.linebr]#/# +
and collects to himself all people.

6 Shall all these not take up a parable against him [.linebr]#/# +
and a taunting proverb against him, [.linebr]#/# +
and say, 'Woe to him who increases that which is not his [.linebr]#/# +
and to him who lades himself with thick clay! How long?'

7 Shall they not rise suddenly who bite you, [.linebr]#/# +
and awake who disturb you, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall be plunder for them?

8 Because you have laid waste many nations, [.linebr]#/# +
all the remnant of the people shall lay you waste, [.linebr]#/# +
because of men's blood [.linebr]#/# +
and for the violence done to the land, [.linebr]#/# +
to the city, and to all who dwell therein.

9 Woe to him who covets an evil gain for his house [.linebr]#/# +
to set his nest on high [.linebr]#/# +
to be delivered from the power of evil!

10 You have devised shame to your house [.linebr]#/# +
by cutting off many people [.linebr]#/# +
and have sinned against your soul.

11 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, [.linebr]#/# +
and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.

12 Woe to him who builds a town with blood [.linebr]#/# +
and establishes a city by iniquity!

13 Behold, is it not from the LORD of hosts [.linebr]#/# +
that the people labor in the fire [.linebr]#/# +
and the people weary themselves for vanity?

14 For the earth shall be filled [.linebr]#/# +
with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
as the waters cover the sea.

15 Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, [.linebr]#/# +
pouring out your bottle to him, [.linebr]#/# +
and also making him drunk, [.linebr]#/# +
so that you may look at their nakedness!

16 You are filled with shame and not glory. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall also drink [.linebr]#/# +
and let your uncircumcision be uncovered. [.linebr]#/# +
The cup of the LORD'S right hand [.linebr]#/# +
shall be turned to you, [.linebr]#/# +
and shameful vomiting shall be on your glory.

17 For the violence done to Lebanon [.linebr]#/# +
shall overwhelm you, [.linebr]#/# +
and the destruction of the beasts [.linebr]#/# +
shall make you afraid, [.linebr]#/# +
because of men's blood [.linebr]#/# +
and for the violence done to the land, [.linebr]#/# +
to the city, and to all who dwell therein.

18 What profit is the engraved image [.linebr]#/# +
when its maker has engraved it— [.linebr]#/# +
the molten image and a teacher of lies— [.linebr]#/# +
that the maker trusts in what he has formed, [.linebr]#/# +
making mute idols?

19 Woe to him who says to wood, 'Awake,' [.linebr]#/# +
and to a mute stone, 'Arise.' [.linebr]#/# +
It shall teach! [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver [.linebr]#/# +
and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

20 But the LORD is in his holy temple. [.linebr]#/# +
Let all the earth keep silence before him."

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Habakkuk, in his prayer, trembles at God's majesty, 1-16. The confidence of his faith, 17-19._

[[hab003-001]]1 [_A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth._]

2 O LORD, I have heard your speech and was afraid. [.linebr]#/# +
O LORD, revive your work in the midst of the years. [.linebr]#/# +
In the midst of the years make it known. [.linebr]#/# +
In wrath remember mercy.

3 God came from Teman, [.linebr]#/# +
and the Holy One from mount Paran. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+ +
His glory covered the heavens, [.linebr]#/# +
and the earth was full of his praise.

4 And his brightness was as the light. [.linebr]#/# +
He had rays coming out of his hand, [.linebr]#/# +
and there was the hiding of his power.

5 Before him went the pestilence, [.linebr]#/# +
and burning coals went forth at his feet.

6 He stood and measured the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
He beheld and drove apart the nations. [.linebr]#/# +
The everlasting mountains were scattered [.linebr]#/# +
and the perpetual hills bowed. [.linebr]#/# +
His ways are everlasting.

7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction. [.linebr]#/# +
And the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.

8 Was the LORD displeased with the rivers? [.linebr]#/# +
Was your anger against the rivers? [.linebr]#/# +
Was your wrath against the sea [.linebr]#/# +
that you rode upon your horses [.linebr]#/# +
and your chariots of salvation?

9 Your bow was made quite ready, [.linebr]#/# +
according to the oaths of the tribes, even your word. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+ +
You cleaved the earth with rivers.

10 The mountains saw you and they trembled. [.linebr]#/# +
The overflowing of the water passed by. [.linebr]#/# +
The deep uttered his voice [.linebr]#/# +
and lifted up his hands on high.

11 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation. [.linebr]#/# +
At the light of your arrows they went, [.linebr]#/# +
and at the shining of your glittering spear.

12 You marched through the land in indignation. [.linebr]#/# +
You threshed the heathen in anger.

13 You went forth for the salvation of your people, [.linebr]#/# +
even for salvation with your anointed. [.linebr]#/# +
You wounded the head of the house of the wicked [.linebr]#/# +
by uncovering the foundation to the neck. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

14 You struck through with his staffs [.linebr]#/# +
the head of his villages. [.linebr]#/# +
They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me. [.linebr]#/# +
Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.

15 You walked through the sea with your horses, [.linebr]#/# +
through the heap of great waters.

16 When I heard, my belly trembled. [.linebr]#/# +
My lips quivered at the voice. [.linebr]#/# +
Rottenness entered into my bones, [.linebr]#/# +
and I trembled in myself, [.linebr]#/# +
so that I might rest in the day of trouble. [.linebr]#/# +
When he comes up to the people, [.linebr]#/# +
he will invade them with his troops.

17 Though the fig-tree does not blossom [.linebr]#/# +
and no fruit is on the vines, [.linebr]#/# +
though the labor of the olive fails [.linebr]#/# +
and the fields yield no food, [.linebr]#/# +
though the flock is cut off from the fold [.linebr]#/# +
and there is no herd in the stalls,

18 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.

19 The LORD God is my strength, [.linebr]#/# +
and he will make my feet like those of a doe [.linebr]#/# +
and make me to walk upon my high places.

+[+ _To the chief singer on my stringed instruments._ +]+
