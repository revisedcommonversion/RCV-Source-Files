[.outline.text-center]
_The divinity, humanity, office, and incarnation of Jesus Christ, 1-14. The testimony of John, 15-38. The calling of Andrew, Peter, etc., 39-51._

1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made by him, and without him nothing was made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.

6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 The same came for a witness to bear testimony of the Light so that all men through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear testimony of that Light.

9 That was the true Light, which lights every man who comes into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, and his own did not receive him. 12 But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God, even to those who believe in his name, 13 Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

14 And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth. 15 John testified concerning him, and cried, saying, "This was he of whom I spoke, 'He who comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.'" 16 And of his fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 18 No man has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.

19 And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" 20 And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ." 21 And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" And he says, "I am not." "Are you that prophet?" And he answered, "No." 22 Then they said to him, "Who are you? For we must give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say of yourself?" [[jhn001-023]]23 He said,

as the prophet Isaiah said."

24 And those who were sent were from the Pharisees. 25 And they asked him, and said to him, "Why do you baptize then, if you are not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?" 26 John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water, but there stands one among you whom you do not know. 27 It is he, who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes' latchet I am not worthy to unloose." 28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan where John was baptizing.

29 The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and says, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. 30 This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.' 31 And I did not know him. But so that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore I have come baptizing with water." 32 And John bore testimony, saying, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed upon him. 33 And I did not know him. But he who sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, 'Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' 34 And I saw and bore testimony that this is the Son of God."

35 Again the next day, John stood, along with two of his disciples, 36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he says, "Behold the Lamb of God!" 37 And the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus. 38 Then Jesus turned and saw them following, and says to them, "[.woc]#What do you seek?#" They said to him, "Rabbi"—which is to say, being interpreted, Master—"where do you dwell?" 39 He says to them, "[.woc]#Come and see.#" They came and saw where he dwelt and stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. 40 One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, "We have found the Messiah," (which is, being interpreted, the Christ). 42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, "[.woc]#You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas,#" (which is, by interpretation, a stone).

43 The day following, Jesus wished to go forth into Galilee and finds Philip, and says to him, "[.woc]#Follow me.#" 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, "We have found him described by Moses in the law and by the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." 46 And Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip says to him, "Come and see." 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, "[.woc]#Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile!#" 48 Nathanael says to him, "Where do you know me from?" Jesus answered and said to him, "[.woc]#Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig-tree, I saw you.#" 49 Nathanael answered and said to him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel." 50 Jesus answered and said to him, "[.woc]#Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig-tree,' do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.#" [[jhn001-051]]51 And he says to him, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open '_and the angels of God ascending and descending_' upon the Son of man.#"

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ turns water into wine, 1-11; departs into Capernaum, 12, and to Jerusalem, 13, where he purges the temple of buyers and sellers, 14-17. He foretells his death and resurrection, 18-22. Many believe because of his miracles, but he will not trust himself with them, 23-25._

1 And on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. 2 And both Jesus and his disciples were called to the marriage. 3 And when they lacked wine, the mother of Jesus says to him, "They have no wine." 4 Jesus says to her, "[.woc]#Woman, what does that have to do with me and you? My hour has not yet come.#" 5 His mother says to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do it." 6 And six water-pots of stone were set there, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece. 7 Jesus says to them, "[.woc]#Fill the water-pots with water.#" And they filled them to the brim. 8 And he says to them, "[.woc]#Draw out now and take it to the master of the feast.#" And they took it. 9 When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and did not know where it was from (but the servants who drew the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom, 10 And says to him, "Every man at the beginning presents good wine, and when men have well drank, then that which is worse. But you have kept the good wine until now." 11 This beginning of miracles Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

12 After this he went down to Capernaum—he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples—and they continued there not many days.

13 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 And he found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting. 15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers' money and overthrew the tables, 16 And said to those who sold doves, "[.woc]#Take these things from here. Do not make my Father's house a house of merchandise.#" [[jhn002-017]]17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, "_The zeal of your house has eaten me up._" 18 Then the Jews answered, and said to him, "What sign do you show to us, seeing that you do these things?" 19 Jesus answered and said to them, "[.woc]#Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.#" 20 Then the Jews said, "Forty-six years this temple was in building, and will you rear it up in three days?" 21 But he spoke of the temple of his body. 22 When therefore he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them. And they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.

23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, on the feast day, many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he performed. 24 But Jesus did not commit himself to them, for he knew all men, 25 And did not need that any should testify concerning man, for he knew what was in man.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ teaches Nicodemus the necessity of regeneration, 1-13, of faith in his death, 14, 15, the great love of God toward the world, 16, 17, and the condemnation for unbelief, 18-21. Jesus baptizes in Judea, 22. The baptism, witness, and doctrine of John concerning Christ, 23-36._

1 There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 2 The same came to Jesus by night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no man can do these miracles that you do unless God is with him." 3 Jesus answered and said to him, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.#"

4 Nicodemus says to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" 5 Jesus answered, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.# 6 [.woc]#That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.# 7 [.woc]#Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You [all] must be born again.'# 8 [.woc]#The wind blows where it wishes and you hear its sound, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. Thus is everyone who is born of the Spirit.#"

9 Nicodemus answered and said to him, "How can these things be?" 10 Jesus answered and said to him, "[.woc]#Are you a teacher of Israel and do not know these things?# 11 [.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak what we know and testify what we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony.# 12 [.woc]#If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?# 13 [.woc]#And no man has ascended to heaven except he who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.# 14 [.woc]#And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up,# 15 [.woc]#So that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.#

16 "[.woc]#For this is how God loved the world: he gave his only-begotten Son, so that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.# 17 [.woc]#For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him may be saved.# 18 [.woc]#He who believes in him is not condemned, but he who does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.# 19 [.woc]#And this is the condemnation: that light has come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.# 20 [.woc]#For everyone who does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.# 21 [.woc]#But he who does truth comes to the light so that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.#"

22 After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea, and there he remained with them and baptized. 23 And John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized. 24 For John was not yet cast into prison.

25 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. 26 And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore testimony, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him." 27 John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from heaven. 28 You yourselves bear me testimony that I said I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. 29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. This joy of mine therefore is fulfilled. 30 He must increase, but I must decrease.

31 "He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. 32 And what he has seen and heard, he testifies, and no man receives his testimony. 33 He who has received his testimony, has set to his seal that God is true. 34 For he whom God has sent, speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure to him. 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. 36 He who believes in the Son has everlasting life, and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ talks with a woman of Samaria and reveals himself to her, 1-26. His disciples marvel, 27-30. He declares to them his zeal for God's glory, 31-38. Many Samaritans believe in him, 39-42. He departs into Galilee and heals the ruler's son who lay sick at Capernaum, 43-54._

1 Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John 2 (Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples), 3 He left Judea and departed again into Galilee. 4 And he must go through Samaria. 5 Then he comes to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat down on the well. And it was about the sixth hour.

7 There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus says to her, "[.woc]#Give me a drink.#" 8 (For his disciples had gone to the city to buy provisions.) 9 Then the woman of Samaria says to him, "How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, being a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans." 10 Jesus answered and said to her, "[.woc]#If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.#" 11 The woman says to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. From where then do you get that living water? 12 Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank from it himself, with his children and his livestock?" 13 Jesus answered and said to her, "[.woc]#Whoever drinks this water shall thirst again,# 14 [.woc]#But whoever drinks the water that I give him shall never thirst. The water that I give him shall be a well of water in him springing up into everlasting life.#"

15 The woman says to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I may not thirst, neither come here to draw." 16 Jesus says to her, "[.woc]#Go, call your husband and come here.#" 17 The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "[.woc]#You have rightly said, 'I have no husband,'# 18 [.woc]#For you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband. In that you have spoken truth.#" 19 The woman says to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. 20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship." 21 Jesus says to her, "[.woc]#Woman, believe me, the hour comes when you shall neither on this mountain nor at Jerusalem worship the Father.# 22 [.woc]#You worship what you do not know. We know what we worship, for salvation is from the Jews.# 23 [.woc]#But the hour comes, and is now, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeks such to worship him.# 24 [.woc]#God is a Spirit. And those who worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.#" 25 The woman says to him, "I know that Messiah comes, who is called Christ. When he has come, he will tell us all things." 26 Jesus says to her, "[.woc]#I, who speak to you, am he.#"

27 And upon this, his disciples came and marveled that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said, "What do you seek?" or, "Why do you talk with her?" 28 The woman then left her water-pot, went into the city, and says to the men, 29 "Come, see a man who has told me all things that I ever did. Is this not the Christ?" 30 Then they went out of the city and came to him.

31 In the meantime, his disciples asked him, saying, "Master, eat." 32 But he said to them, "[.woc]#I have food to eat that you do not know of.#" 33 Therefore, the disciples said to one another, "Has any man brought him anything to eat?" 34 Jesus says to them, "[.woc]#My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.# 35 [.woc]#Do you not say, 'There are yet four months and then comes harvest'? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest.# 36 [.woc]#And he who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit to eternal life, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.# 37 [.woc]#And herein that saying is true: 'One sows and another reaps.'# 38 [.woc]#I sent you to reap that on which you bestowed no labor. Other men labored, and you have entered into their labors.#"

39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him for the saying of the woman, who testified, "He told me all that I ever did." 40 So when the Samaritans had come to him, they implored him that he would stay with them. And he stayed there two days. 41 And many more believed because of his own word, 42 And said to the woman, "Now we believe, and not because of what you said, for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world."

43 Now after two days he departed from there and went into Galilee. 44 For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. 45 Then when he had come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.

46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee where he made the water into wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. 47 When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him and implored him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. 48 Then Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.#" 49 The nobleman says to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies." 50 Jesus says to him, "[.woc]#Go. Your son lives.#" And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him and departed. 51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, "Your son lives." 52 Then he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him." 53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives." And he himself believed, along with his whole house. 54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus performed when he had come from Judea into Galilee.

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_Jesus, on the sabbath day, cures him who was diseased thirty-eight years, 1-9. The Jews therefore make a trivial objection and persecute Jesus for it, 10-16. He answers for himself and reproves them, showing who he is by the testimony of his Father, 17-30, of John, 31-35, of his works, 36-38, and of the Scriptures, 39-47._

1 After this, there was a feast of the Jews. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2 Now there is a pool in Jerusalem by the sheep market, which is called in the Hebrew language, Bethesda, having five porches. 3 In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and agitated the water. Then whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was cured of whatever disease he had. 5 And a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years. 6 When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he says to him, "[.woc]#Do you wish to be healed?#" 7 The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is agitated. But while I am coming, another steps down before me." 8 Jesus says to him, "[.woc]#Rise, take up your bed, and walk.#" 9 And immediately the man was healed and he took up his bed and walked. Now on the same day was the sabbath. 10 The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, "It is the sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry your bed." 11 He answered them, "He who healed me, the same said to me, 'Take up your bed and walk.'" 12 Then they asked him, "What man is this who said to you, 'Take up your bed and walk'?" 13 And he who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. 14 Afterward, Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, "[.woc]#Behold, you are cured. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come to you.#" 15 The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. 16 And therefore, the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath. 17 But Jesus answered them, "[.woc]#My Father works until now, and I also work.#"

18 Therefore, the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.

19 Then Jesus answered and said to them, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing by himself, but what he sees the Father do. For whatever things he does, these also the Son does likewise.# 20 [.woc]#For the Father loves the Son and shows him all things that he himself does. And he will show him greater works than these so that you may marvel.# 21 [.woc]#For as the Father raises the dead and revives them, even so the Son revives whom he wishes.# 22 [.woc]#For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son,# 23 [.woc]#So that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who has sent him.#

24 "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes in him who sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but has passed from death to life.#

25 "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and is now, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God. And those who hear shall live.# 26 [.woc]#For as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son to have life in himself,# 27 [.woc]#And has given him authority to execute judgment because he is the Son of man.# 28 [.woc]#Do not marvel at this. For the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves shall hear his voice,# 29 [.woc]#And shall come forth—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation.#

30 "[.woc]#I can of my own self do nothing. As I hear, I judge. And my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the Father who has sent me.#

31 "[.woc]#If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true.# 32 [.woc]#There is another who testifies concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he bears concerning me is true.#

33 "[.woc]#You sent to John and he testified to the truth.# 34 [.woc]#But I do not receive testimony from man. But these things I say so that you may be saved.# 35 [.woc]#He was a burning and a shining light, and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.#

36 "[.woc]#But I have greater testimony than that of John. For the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear testimony concerning me that the Father has sent me.#

37 "[.woc]#And the Father himself who has sent me has borne testimony concerning me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.# 38 [.woc]#And you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent.#

39 "[.woc]#You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and they are those which testify of me.# 40 [.woc]#And you will not come to me so that you may have life.# 41 [.woc]#I do not receive honor from men.# 42 [.woc]#But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.# 43 [.woc]#I have come in my Father's name and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.# 44 [.woc]#How can you believe, who receive honor from one another and do not seek the honor that comes from God only?# 45 [.woc]#Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.# 46 [.woc]#For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me, for he wrote concerning me.# 47 [.woc]#But if you do not believe his writings, how shall you believe my words?#"

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ feeds five thousand men with five loaves and two fish, 1-14. Thereupon the people would have made him king, 15; but withdrawing himself, he walks on the sea to his disciples, 16-25; reproves the people flocking after him and all the fleshly hearers of his word, 26-31; declares himself to be the bread of life to believers, 32-65. Many disciples depart from him, 66, 67. Peter confesses him, 68, 69. Judas is a devil, 70, 71._

1 After these things, Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. 2 And a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he performed on those who were diseased. 3 And Jesus went upon a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near. 5 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come to him, he says to Philip, "[.woc]#Where shall we buy bread so that these may eat?#" 6 (And he said this to prove him, for he himself knew what he would do.) 7 Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, so that each of them may receive a little." 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him, 9 "There is a boy here who has five barley-loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?" 10 And Jesus said, "[.woc]#Make the men sit down.#" (Now there was much grass in the place.) So the men sat down in number about five thousand. 11 And Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down, and likewise with the fish, as much as they wished. 12 When they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, "[.woc]#Gather the fragments that remain so that nothing may be lost.#" 13 Therefore, they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves which remained over and above by those who had eaten. 14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus performed, said, "This is truly that prophet who should come into the world."

15 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king, he departed again to a mountain by himself alone.

16 And when evening had now come, his disciples went down to the sea, 17 Entered into a boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. It was now dark and Jesus had not come to them. 18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. 19 So when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat, and they were afraid. 20 But he says to them, "[.woc]#It is I. Do not be afraid.#" 21 Then they willingly received him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.

22 The day following, when the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples had gone away alone 23 (Yet there came other boats from Tiberias near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks), 24 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus. 25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"

26 Jesus answered them and said, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you ate the loaves and were satisfied.# 27 [.woc]#Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for that food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give to you, for God the Father has sealed him.#" 28 Then they said to him, "What shall we do so that we may work the works of God?" 29 Jesus answered and said to them, "[.woc]#This is the work of God: that you believe in him whom he has sent.#" 30 They said therefore to him, "What sign do you show then so that we may see and believe you? What do you work? [[jhn006-031]]31 Our fathers ate manna in the desert. As it is written, '_He gave them bread from heaven to eat._'" 32 Then Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you that bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.# 33 [.woc]#For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world." 34 Then they said to him, "Lord, always give us this bread.#"

35 And Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#I am the bread of life. He who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.# 36 [.woc]#But I said to you, that you also have seen me and do not believe.# 37 [.woc]#All whom the Father gives me shall come to me, and he who comes to me, I will in no way reject.# 38 [.woc]#For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.# 39 [.woc]#And this is the Father's will who has sent me: that of all which he has given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.# 40 [.woc]#And this is the will of him who sent me: that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have everlasting life. And I will raise him up at the last day.#"

41 The Jews then murmured at him because he said, "I am the bread which came down from heaven." 42 And they said, "Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that he says, 'I came down from heaven'?" 43 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, "[.woc]#Do not murmur among yourselves.# 44 [.woc]#No man can come to me unless the Father who has sent me draws him. And I will raise him up at the last day.# [[jhn006-045]]45 [.woc]#It is written in the prophets, '_And they shall be all taught from God._' Every man therefore who has heard and has learned from the Father comes to me.# 46 [.woc]#Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.# 47 [.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me has everlasting life.# 48 [.woc]#I am that bread of life.# 49 [.woc]#Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness and are dead.# 50 [.woc]#This is the bread which comes down from heaven so that a man may eat of it and not die.# 51 [.woc]#I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any man eats of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.#"

52 The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" 53 Then Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.# 54 [.woc]#Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life. And I will raise him up at the last day.# 55 [.woc]#For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.# 56 [.woc]#He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me, and I in him.# 57 [.woc]#As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he who eats me, even he shall live by me.# 58 [.woc]#This is that bread which came down from heaven—not as your fathers ate manna and are dead. He who eats of this bread shall live forever.#"

59 He said these things in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.

60 Therefore, when they had heard this, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard saying. Who can hear it?" 61 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, "[.woc]#Does this offend you?# 62 [.woc]#What if you see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?# 63 [.woc]#It is the Spirit that revives. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you, they are spirit and they are life.# 64 [.woc]#But there are some of you who do not believe.#" For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe and who he was who would betray him. 65 And he said, "[.woc]#Therefore, I said to you, that no man can come to me unless it were given to him by my Father.#"

66 From that time many of his disciples went back and no longer walked with him. 67 Then Jesus said to the twelve, "[.woc]#Will you also go away?#" 68 Then Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God." 70 Jesus answered them, "[.woc]#Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?#" 71 He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon. For it was he who was to betray him, being one of the twelve.

=== Chapter 7

[.outline.text-center]
_Jesus reproves the ambition and boldness of his kinsmen, 1-9; goes up from Galilee to the feast of tabernacles, 10-13; teaches in the temple, 14-39. Various opinions of him among the people, 40-44. The Pharisees are angry that their officers did not take him, and they chide with Nicodemus for taking his part, 45-53._

1 After these things, Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Judea because the Jews sought to kill him. 2 Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand. 3 His brothers therefore said to him, "Depart from here and go into Judea so that your disciples may also see the works that you do. 4 For there is no man who does anything in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world." 5 (For neither did his brothers believe in him.) 6 Then Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.# 7 [.woc]#The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil.# 8 [.woc]#Go up to this feast. I do not yet go to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.#" 9 When he had said these words to them, he still stayed in Galilee.

10 But when his brothers had gone up, then he also went to the feast, not openly, but as in secret. 11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, "Where is he?" 12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him. For some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "No, but he deceives the people." 13 Yet, no man spoke openly about him for fear of the Jews.

14 Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. 15 And the Jews marveled, saying, "How does this man know letters, having never learned?" 16 Jesus answered them, and said, "[.woc]#My doctrine is not mine, but his who sent me.# 17 [.woc]#If any man will do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God, or whether I speak from myself.# 18 [.woc]#He who speaks from himself, seeks his own glory, but he who seeks his glory who sent him, the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him.# 19 [.woc]#Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?#" 20 The people answered and said, "You have a demon. Who seeks to kill you?" 21 Jesus answered and said to them, "[.woc]#I have done one work and you all marvel.# 22 [.woc]#Moses therefore gave to you circumcision (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you on the sabbath circumcise a man.# 23 [.woc]#If a man on the sabbath receives circumcision so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry at me because I have restored a man to sound health on the sabbath?# 24 [.woc]#Do not judge according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.#"

25 Then some of them of Jerusalem said, "Is this not he whom they seek to kill? 26 But behold, he speaks boldly and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? 27 But we know this man, where he is from; whereas when Christ comes, no man knows where he is from." 28 Then Jesus cried in the temple as he taught, saying, "[.woc]#You both know me and you know where I am from. And I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you do not know.# 29 [.woc]#But I know him because I am from him and he has sent me.#" 30 Then they sought to take him. But no man laid hands on him because his hour had not yet come. 31 And many of the people believed in him, and said, "When Christ comes, will he do more miracles than these which this man has done?"

32 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him. And the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. 33 Then Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him who sent me.# 34 [.woc]#You will seek me and will not find me. And where I am, there you cannot come.#" 35 Then the Jews said among themselves, "Where will he go that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles? 36 What manner of saying is this that he said, 'You will seek me and will not find me,' and, 'Where I am, there you cannot come'?"

37 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, "[.woc]#If any man thirsts, let him come to me and drink.# 38 [.woc]#He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.#" 39 (But this he spoke of the Spirit, which those who believe in him would receive, for the Holy Spirit had not yet been given because Jesus was not yet glorified.)

40 Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, "In truth this is the Prophet." 41 Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "Will Christ come out of Galilee? 42 Has the Scripture not said that Christ comes from the offspring of David and out of the town of Bethlehem where David was?" 43 So there was a division among the people because of him. 44 And some of them would have taken him, but no man laid hands on him.

45 Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why have you not brought him?" 46 The officers answered, "Never a man spoke like this man." 47 Then the Pharisees answered them, "Are you also deceived? 48 Have any of the rulers or any of the Pharisees believed in him? 49 But these people who do not know the law are cursed." 50 Nicodemus (he who came to Jesus by night, being one of them) says to them, 51 "Does our law judge any man before it hears him and knows what he does?" 52 They answered and said to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search, and look. For out of Galilee no prophet arises." 53 And every man went to his own house.

_Christ delivers the woman taken in adultery, 1-11. He declares himself the light of the world and justifies his doctrine, 12-30; promises freedom to those who believe, 31, 32; answers the Jews who boasted of Abraham, 33-47; answers their reviling by showing his authority and dignity, 48-58; and conveys himself from their cruelty, 59._

1 Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple. And all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. 3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman to him taken in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, 4 They say to him, "Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 5 Now in the law, Moses commanded us that such should be stoned, but what do you say?" 6 They said this, testing him, so that they might have reason to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger as though he did not hear them. 7 So when they continued asking him, he raised himself and said to them, "[.woc]#He who is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her.#" 8 And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. 9 And those who heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even to the last. And Jesus was left alone with the woman standing in the midst. 10 When Jesus had raised himself and saw no one except the woman, he said to her, "[.woc]#Woman, where are your accusers? Has no man condemned you?#" 11 She said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said to her, "[.woc]#Neither do I condemn you. Go, and sin no more.#"

12 Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, "[.woc]#I am the light of the world. He who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.#" 13 The Pharisees therefore said to him, "You testify concerning yourself. Your testimony is not true." 14 Jesus answered and said to them, "[.woc]#Though I testify concerning myself, yet my testimony is true. For I know where I came from and where I go, but you cannot tell where I come from and where I go.# 15 [.woc]#You judge after the flesh. I judge no man.# 16 [.woc]#And yet if I judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.# 17 [.woc]#It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.# 18 [.woc]#I am one who testifies concerning myself, and the Father who sent me testifies concerning me.#" 19 Then they said to him, "Where is your Father?" Jesus answered, "[.woc]#You neither know me, nor my Father. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.#" 20 Jesus spoke these words in the treasury as he taught in the temple. And no man laid hands on him, for his hour had not yet come.

21 Then Jesus again said to them, "[.woc]#I am going away, and you will seek me, and will die in your sins. Where I go, you cannot come.#" 22 Then the Jews said, "Will he kill himself, because he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?" 23 And he said to them, "[.woc]#You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.# 24 [.woc]#Therefore, I said to you, that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.#" 25 Then they said to him, "Who are you?" And Jesus says to them, "[.woc]#Even the same that I said to you from the beginning.# 26 [.woc]#I have many things to say and to judge of you. But he who sent me is true, and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him.#" 27 They did not understand that he spoke to them concerning the Father. 28 Then Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you shall know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself. But as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.# 29 [.woc]#And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, for I always do those things that please him.#" 30 As he spoke these words, many believed in him.

31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him, "[.woc]#If you continue in my word, you are my disciples indeed.# 32 [.woc]#And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.#" 33 They answered him, "We are Abraham's offspring and were never in bondage to any man. How do you say, 'You shall be made free'?"

34 Jesus answered them, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.# 35 [.woc]#And the servant does not abide in the house forever, but the Son abides forever.# 36 [.woc]#If the Son therefore makes you free, you shall be free indeed.# 37 [.woc]#I know that you are Abraham's offspring, but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you.# 38 [.woc]#I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and you do that which you have seen with your father.#"

39 They answered and said to him, "Abraham is our father." Jesus says to them, "[.woc]#If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.# 40 [.woc]#But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I have heard from God. Abraham did not do this.# 41 [.woc]#You do the deeds of your father.#" Then they said to him, "We are not born of fornication. We have one Father: God." 42 Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#If God were your Father, you would love me. For I proceeded forth and came from God, neither did I come of myself, but he sent me.# 43 [.woc]#Why do you not understand my speech? It is because you cannot hear my word.# 44 [.woc]#You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not abide in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own, for he is a liar and the father of lies.# 45 [.woc]#And because I tell you the truth, you do not believe me.# 46 [.woc]#Which of you convicts me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?# 47 [.woc]#He who is of God hears God's words. For this cause you do not hear them, because you are not of God.#"

48 Then the Jews answered and said to him, "Do we not say rightly that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?" 49 Jesus answered, "[.woc]#I do not have a demon. But I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.# 50 [.woc]#And I do not seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.# 51 [.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, if a man keeps my saying, he shall never see death.#" 52 Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets also, and you say, 'If a man keeps my saying, he shall never taste death.' 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham who is dead? And the prophets are also dead. Whom do you make yourself out to be?" 54 Jesus answered, "[.woc]#If I honor myself, my honor is nothing. It is my Father who honors me, of whom you say that he is your God.# 55 [.woc]#Yet you have not known him, but I know him. And if I say, 'I do not know him,' I would be a liar like you. But I know him and keep his saying.# 56 [.woc]#Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it and was glad.#" 57 Then the Jews said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?" [[jhn008-058]]58 Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, '_I AM._'#" 59 Then they took up stones to cast at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and thus passed by.

_The man who was born blind has his sight restored, 1-7. He is brought to the Pharisees, 8-12. They are offended by it and excommunicate him, 13-34; but he is received by Jesus and confesses him, 35-38. Who they are whom Christ enlightens, 39-41._

1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man who was blind from his birth. 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, "Master, who sinned, this man or his parents, so that he was born blind?" 3 Jesus answered, "[.woc]#Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents, but this is so that the works of God should be made manifest in him.# 4 [.woc]#I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. The night comes when no man can work.# 5 [.woc]#As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.#" 6 When he had thus spoken, he spit on the ground, made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, 7 And said to him, "[.woc]#Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,#" (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went therefore and washed and came seeing. 8 Therefore, the neighbors and those who before had seen that he was blind said, "Is this not he who sat and begged?" 9 Some said, "This is he." Others said, "He is like him." But he said, "I am he." 10 Therefore, they said to him, "How were your eyes opened?" 11 He answered and said, "A man who is called Jesus made clay, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.' And I went and washed and I received sight." 12 Then they said to him, "Where is he?" He said, "I do not know."

13 They brought him who before was blind to the Pharisees. 14 And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. 15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, "He put clay upon my eyes, I washed, and now I see." 16 Therefore, some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God because he does not keep the sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such miracles?" And there was a division among them. 17 They say to the blind man again, "What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."

18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight. 19 And they asked them, saying, "Is this your son who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?" 20 His parents answered them and said, "We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. 21 But by what means he now sees, we do not know, or who has opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself." 22 His parents spoke these words because they feared the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that if any man confessed that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. 23 Therefore, his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him."

24 Then again they called the man who was blind and said to him, "Give God the praise. We know that this man is a sinner." 25 He answered and said, "Whether he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see." 26 Then they said to him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?" 27 He answered them, "I have told you already and you did not hear. Why would you hear it again? Will you also be his disciples?" 28 Then they reviled him, and said, "You are his disciple, but we are the disciples of Moses. 29 We know that God spoke to Moses. As for this man, we do not know where he is from." 30 The man answered and said to them, "Why, herein is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he has opened my eyes. 31 Now we know that God does not hear sinners. But if any man is a worshiper of God and does his will, he hears him. 32 Since the world began it has not been heard that any man opened the eyes of one who was born blind. 33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing." 34 They answered and said to him, "You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?" And they cast him out.

35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And when he had found him, he said to him, "[.woc]#Do you believe in the Son of God?#" 36 He answered and said, "Who is he, Lord, so that I may believe in him?" 37 And Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#You have both seen him and it is he who talks with you.#" 38 And he said, "Lord, I believe." And he worshiped him. 39 And Jesus said, "[.woc]#For judgment I have come into this world so that those who do not see may see, and that those who do see may be made blind.#" 40 And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these words and said to him, "Are we also blind?" 41 Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#If you were blind, you would have no sin. But now you say, 'We see.' Therefore, your sin remains.#"

_Christ is the door and the good shepherd, 1-18. Various opinions about him, 19-22. He proves by his works that he is Christ the Son of God, 23-30; escapes the Jews, 31-38; and goes again beyond the Jordan where many believe in him, 39-42._

1 "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the sheep-fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.# 2 [.woc]#But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.# 3 [.woc]#To him the gatekeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice. And he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.# 4 [.woc]#And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.# 5 [.woc]#And a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.#" 6 Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they did not understand what things those were which he spoke to them.

7 Then Jesus said to them again, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.# 8 [.woc]#All who ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.# 9 [.woc]#I am the door. If any man enters through me, he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture.# 10 [.woc]#The thief does not come, but to steal, to kill, and to destroy. I have come so that they may have life and have it more abundantly.#

11 "[.woc]#I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.# 12 [.woc]#But he who is a hireling and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep.# 13 [.woc]#The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care for the sheep.# 14 [.woc]#I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,# 15 [.woc]#Even as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.# [[jhn010-016]]16 [.woc]#And I have other sheep which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they shall hear my voice. And there shall be one fold and one shepherd.# 17 [.woc]#Therefore, my Father loves me because I lay down my life so that I may take it back.# 18 [.woc]#No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it back. This commandment I have received from my Father.#"

19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews because of these sayings. 20 And many of them said, "He has a demon and is insane. Why do you hear him?" 21 Others said, "These are not the words of him who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"

22 And it was the feast of the dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter. 23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. 24 Then the Jews came around him and said to him, "How long do you make us to doubt? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly." 25 Jesus answered them, "[.woc]#I told you, and you did not believe. The works that I did in my Father's name, they testify concerning me.# 26 [.woc]#But you do not believe because you are not among my sheep, as I said to you.# [[jhn010-027]]27 [.woc]#My sheep hear my voice, and I know them. They follow me,# 28 [.woc]#And I give eternal life to them. They shall never perish, and no one shall pluck them out of my hand.# 29 [.woc]#My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.# 30 [.woc]#I and my Father are one.#"

31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 32 Jesus answered them, "[.woc]#I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?#" 33 The Jews answered him, saying, "For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God." [[jhn010-034]]34 Jesus answered them, "[.woc]#Is it not written in your law, '_I said, "You are gods"_'?# 35 [.woc]#If he called them gods to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken,# 36 [.woc]#Do you say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?# 37 [.woc]#If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me.# 38 [.woc]#But if I do, though you do not believe me, believe the works so that you may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in him.#" 39 Therefore, they sought again to take him, but he escaped from their hand.

40 And he went again beyond the Jordan into the place where John at first baptized, and he stayed there. 41 And many resorted to him, and said, "John performed no miracle, but all things that John spoke about this man were true." 42 And many believed in him there.

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ raises Lazarus, who was buried four days, 1-44. Many Jews believe, 45, 46. The high priests and Pharisees gather a council against Christ, 47, 48. Caiaphas prophesies, 49-53. Jesus hides himself, 54. At the passover they inquire about him and lay wait for him, 55-57._

1 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, from Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. 2 (It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) 3 Therefore, his sisters sent to him, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick." 4 When Jesus heard that, he said, "[.woc]#This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.#" 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus. 6 When therefore he had heard that he was sick, he remained two days in the same place where he was. 7 Then after that he says to his disciples, "[.woc]#Let us go into Judea again.#" 8 His disciples say to him, "Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you, and you go there again?" 9 Jesus answered, "[.woc]#Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world.# 10 [.woc]#But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles because there is no light in him.#" 11 He said these things, and after that, he says to them, "[.woc]#Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go so that I may awake him out of sleep.#" 12 Then his disciples said, "Lord, if he sleeps he will do well." 13 Now Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep. 14 Then Jesus said to them plainly, "[.woc]#Lazarus is dead.# 15 [.woc]#And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let us go to him.#" 16 Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples, "Let us also go so that we may die with him."

17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. 18 (Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs distant.) 19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother. 20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him, but Mary sat in the house. 21 Then Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 22 But I know that even now, whatever you will ask of God, God will give it to you." 23 Jesus says to her, "[.woc]#Your brother shall rise again.#" 24 Martha says to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day." 25 Jesus said to her, "[.woc]#I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, even if he were dead, he shall live.# 26 [.woc]#And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?#" 27 She says to him, "Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world."

28 And when she had said this, she went and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, "The Master has come and calls for you." 29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came to him.

30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 31 Then the Jews who were with her in the house and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose hastily and went out, followed her, saying, "She goes to the grave to weep there." 32 Then when Mary had come where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died." 33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit and was troubled, 34 And said, "[.woc]#Where have you laid him?#" They say to him, "Lord, come and see." 35 Jesus wept. 36 Then the Jews said, "Behold how he loved him!" 37 And some of them said, "Could this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, not have kept this man from dying?"

38 Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, comes to the grave. It was a cave and a stone lay upon it. 39 Jesus said, "[.woc]#Take away the stone.#" Martha, the sister of him who was dead, says to him, "Lord, by this time he smells, for he has been dead four days." 40 Jesus says to her, "[.woc]#Did I not say to you, that if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?#" 41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, "[.woc]#Father, I thank you that you have heard me.# 42 [.woc]#And I knew that you hear me always. But because of the people who stand by, I said it, so that they may believe that you have sent me.#" 43 And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, "[.woc]#Lazarus, come forth.#" 44 And he who was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus says to them, "[.woc]#Unbind him, and let him go.#"

45 Then many of the Jews who came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed in him. 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what things Jesus had done.

47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and said, "What do we do? For this man performs many miracles. 48 If we leave him alone like this, all men will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation." 49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, "You know nothing at all, 50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish." 51 And he did not speak this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation, 52 And not for that nation only, but that also he should assemble in one the children of God who were scattered abroad. 53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death.

54 Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to a country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.

55 And the Jews' passover was near at hand. And many went out of the country to Jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves. 56 Then they sought for Jesus and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, "What do you think—that he will not come to the feast?" 57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should report it so that they might take him.

[.outline.text-center]
_Jesus excuses Mary anointing his feet, 1-8. The people flock to see Lazarus, 9. The chief priests consult to kill him, 10, 11. Christ rides into Jerusalem, 12-19. Greeks desire to see Jesus, 20-22. He foretells his death, 23-36. The Jews are generally blinded, 37-41; yet many chief rulers believe, but do not confess him, 42, 43; therefore Jesus calls earnestly for confession of faith, 44-50._

1 Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 2 There they made him a supper, and Martha served. And Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him. 3 Then Mary took a pound of very costly ointment of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment. 4 Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who was to betray him, says, 5 "Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?" 6 He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief. And having the money-box, he took away what was put in it. 7 Then Jesus said, "[.woc]#Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.# 8 [.woc]#For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.#"

9 Many people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there. And they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but so that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 10 But the chief priests consulted that they might also put Lazarus to death, 11 Because by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.

12 On the next day, many people who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, [[jhn012-013]]13 Took branches of palm-trees and went forth to meet him, and cried,

16 These things his disciples did not understand at the first, but when Jesus was glorified, they remembered that these things were written concerning him and that they had done these things to him. 17 Therefore, the people who were with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead, bore testimony. 18 For this cause the people also met him, for they heard that he had done this miracle. 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "Do you perceive how you prevail nothing? Behold, the world has gone after him."

20 And there were some Greeks among them who came to worship at the feast. 21 The same came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus." 22 Philip comes and tells Andrew, and again, Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. 23 And Jesus answered them, saying, "[.woc]#The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.# 24 [.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone. But if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.# 25 [.woc]#He who loves his life shall lose it, and he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.# 26 [.woc]#If any man serves me, let him follow me, and where I am, there my servant shall also be. If any man serves me, my Father will honor him.#

[[jhn012-027]]27 "[.woc]#Now '_my soul is troubled,_' and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came to this hour.# 28 [.woc]#Father, glorify your name.#" Then there came a voice from heaven, saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again." 29 Therefore, the people who stood by and heard it said that it thundered. Others said, "An angel spoke to him." 30 Jesus answered and said, "[.woc]#This voice did not come because of me, but for your sakes.# 31 [.woc]#Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world shall be cast out.# 32 [.woc]#And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.#" 33 (He said this signifying what death he should die.) 34 The people answered him, "We have heard out of the law that Christ abides forever. How do you say, 'The Son of man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of man?" 35 Then Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you. For he who walks in darkness does not know where he goes.# 36 [.woc]#While you have light, believe in the light so that you may be the children of light.#" Jesus spoke these things, departed, and concealed himself from them. 37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they did not believe in him, [[jhn012-038]]38 So that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke,

|"_Lord, who has believed our report?_ [.linebr]#/# +

39 Therefore, they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,

41 Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke about him. 42 Nevertheless, also among the chief rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue. 43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

44 Jesus cried, and said, "[.woc]#He who believes in me does not believe in me, but in him who sent me.# 45 [.woc]#And he who sees me, sees him who sent me.# 46 [.woc]#I have come as a light into the world so that whoever believes in me should not abide in darkness.# 47 [.woc]#And if any man hears my words and does not believe, I do not judge him.

But the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say and what I should speak.# 50 [.woc]#And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. Whatever I speak therefore, even as the Father said to me, so I speak.#"

=== Chapter 13

[.outline.text-center]
_Jesus washes the disciples' feet and exhorts them to humility and charity, 1-17. He foretells and reveals to John by a token that Judas should betray him, 18-30; commands them to love one another, 31-35; and forewarns Peter of his denial, 36-38._

1 Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. 2 And during supper (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him), 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going to God, 4 Rises from supper, laid aside his garments, took a towel, and girded himself.

5 After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. 6 Then he comes to Simon Peter, and Peter says to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?" 7 Jesus answered and said to him, "[.woc]#What I do you do not now know, but you shall know hereafter.#" 8 Peter says to him, "You shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "[.woc]#If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.#" 9 Simon Peter says to him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head." 10 Jesus says to him, "[.woc]#He who is washed has no need except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean. And you are clean, but not all.#" 11 For he knew who would betray him; therefore, he said, "You are not all clean."

12 So after he had washed their feet, had taken his garments, and had sat down again, he said to them, "[.woc]#Do you know what I have done to you?# 13 [.woc]#You call me Master and Lord, and you speak rightly, for I am so.# 14 [.woc]#If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.# 15 [.woc]#For I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you.# 16 [.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, the servant is not greater than his lord, neither he who is sent greater than he who sent him.# 17 [.woc]#If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.# [[jhn013-018]]18 [.woc]#I do not speak of you all. I know whom I have chosen, but this is so that the Scripture may be fulfilled: '_He who eats bread with me, has lifted up his heel against me._'# 19 [.woc]#Now I tell you before it comes, so that when it has come to pass, you may believe that I am he.# 20 [.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.#"

21 When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit and testified, and said, "[.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray me.#" 22 Then the disciples looked at one another, doubting of whom he spoke. 23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him to ask who it should be of whom he spoke. 25 Then lying on Jesus' chest, he says to him, "Lord, who is it?" 26 Jesus answered, "[.woc]#It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.#" And when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 27 And after the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#What you do, do quickly.#" 28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him. 29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the money-box, that Jesus had told him to buy those things that they had need of for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor. 30 Then having received the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.

31 Therefore, when he had gone out, Jesus said, "[.woc]#Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.# 32 [.woc]#If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will glorify him immediately.# 33 [.woc]#Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I go, you cannot come,' so now I say to you.# 34 [.woc]#A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. As I have loved you, you also should love one another.# 35 [.woc]#By this all men shall know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.#"

36 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where do you go?" Jesus answered him, "[.woc]#Where I go, you cannot follow me now, but you shall follow me afterward.#" 37 Peter said to him, "Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake." 38 Jesus answered him, "[.woc]#Will you lay down your life for my sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow until you have denied me three times.#"

1 "[.woc]#These things I have spoken to you so that you should not be offended.# 2 [.woc]#They shall put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, the time comes, that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.# 3 [.woc]#And these things they will do to you because they have not known the Father, nor me.# 4 [.woc]#But these things I have told you so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. And these things I did not say to you at the beginning because I was with you.#

5 "[.woc]#But now I go to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'# 6 [.woc]#But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.# 7 [.woc]#Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I depart. For if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you. But if I depart, I will send him to you.# 8 [.woc]#And when he has come, he will reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment:# 9 [.woc]#Of sin, because they do not believe in me;# 10 [.woc]#Of righteousness, because I go to my Father and you will no longer see me;# 11 [.woc]#Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.#

12 "[.woc]#I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.# 13 [.woc]#But when the Spirit of truth has come, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears, that he will speak. And he will declare to you the things that are to come.# 14 [.woc]#He will glorify me, for he will receive from what is mine and will declare it to you.# 15 [.woc]#All things that the Father has are mine; therefore, I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.#

16 "[.woc]#A little while, and you shall not see me. And again a little while, and you shall see me because I go to the Father.#" 17 Then some of his disciples said among themselves, "What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you shall not see me. And again a little while, and you shall see me,' and, 'Because I go to the Father'?" 18 They said therefore, "What is this that he says, 'A little while'? We cannot tell what he says." 19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said to them, "[.woc]#Do you inquire among yourselves of that which I said, 'A little while, and you shall not see me. And again a little while, and you shall see me'?# 20 [.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. And you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.# 21 [.woc]#A woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour has come. But as soon as she delivers the child, she no longer remembers the anguish because of her joy that a man is born into the world.# 22 [.woc]#Now, therefore, you also have sorrow. But I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and no man takes your joy from you.#

23 "[.woc]#And in that day you will ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.# 24 [.woc]#Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask and you shall receive so that your joy may be full.#

25 "[.woc]#These things I have spoken to you in proverbs, but the time comes when I shall no longer speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly concerning the Father.# 26 [.woc]#At that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,# 27 [.woc]#For the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.# 28 [.woc]#I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.#"

29 His disciples said to him, "Behold, now you speak plainly and speak no proverb. 30 Now we are sure that you know all things and do not need that any man should ask you. By this we believe that you came from God." 31 Jesus answered them, "[.woc]#Do you now believe?# 32 [.woc]#Behold, the hour comes and has even now come, that you shall each be scattered to his own and shall leave me alone. And yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.# 33 [.woc]#These things I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer. I have overcome the world.#"

_Christ prays to his Father, 1-26._

1 Jesus spoke these words and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, "[.woc]#Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that your Son also may glorify you,# 2 [.woc]#As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.# 3 [.woc]#And this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.# 4 [.woc]#I have glorified you on the earth. I have finished the work which you gave me to do.# 5 [.woc]#And now, O Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.#

6 "[.woc]#I have manifested your name to the men whom you gave to me out of the world. They were yours and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.# 7 [.woc]#Now they have known that everything you have given me comes from you.# 8 [.woc]#For I have given to them the words which you gave me, and they have received them and have known surely that I came from you. And they have believed that you sent me.# 9 [.woc]#I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom you have given to me, for they are yours.# 10 [.woc]#And all mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.# 11 [.woc]#And now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep, through your own name, those whom you have given to me so that they may be one, as we are.# 12 [.woc]#While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you gave to me I have kept, and not one of them is lost but the son of perdition, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.#

13 "[.woc]#And now I come to you, and these things I speak in the world so that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.# 14 [.woc]#I have given to them your word. And the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.# 15 [.woc]#I do not pray that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil.# 16 [.woc]#They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.# 17 [.woc]#Sanctify them through your truth. Your word is truth. 18 As you have sent me into the world, even so I have also sent them into the world.# 19 [.woc]#And for their sakes I sanctify myself so that they also may be sanctified through the truth.#

20 "[.woc]#I do not pray for these alone, but for those also who shall believe in me through their word,# 21 [.woc]#So that they all may be one, as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, and that they also may be one in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.#

22 "[.woc]#And the glory which you gave to me I have given to them so that they may be one, even as we are one.# 23 [.woc]#I am in them and you are in me so that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them as you have loved me.# 24 [.woc]#Father, I wish that they also whom you have given to me be with me where I am so that they may behold my glory which you have given to me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.#

25 "[.woc]#O righteous Father, the world has not known you. But I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.# 26 [.woc]#And I have declared to them your name, and will declare it, so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.#"

_Judas betrays Jesus, 1-5. The officers fall to the ground, 6-9. Peter smites off Malchus' ear, 10, 11. Jesus is taken and led to Annas and Caiaphas, 12-14. Peter's denial, 15-18. Jesus examined before Caiaphas, 19-24. Peter's second and third denial, 25-27. Jesus arraigned before Pilate, 28-35. His kingdom, 36-39. The Jews prefer Barabbas, 40._

1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kedron, where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered. 2 And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place, for Jesus often resorted there with his disciples. 3 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. 4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth and said to them, "[.woc]#Whom do you seek?#" 5 They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus says to them, "[.woc]#I am he.#" And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them. 6 Then as soon as he had said to them, "I am he," they went backward and fell to the ground. 7 Then he asked them again, "[.woc]#Whom do you seek?#" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth." 8 Jesus answered, "[.woc]#I have told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go away,#" 9 So that the saying might be fulfilled which he spoke: "Of those whom you gave to me, I have lost not one." 10 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. 11 Then Jesus said to Peter, "[.woc]#Put up your sword into the sheath. The cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?#"

12 Then the band, the captain, and officers of the Jews took Jesus, bound him, 13 And led him away to Annas first (for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that same year). 14 Now Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.

15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. 16 But Peter stood at the door outside. Then that other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to her who kept the door and brought in Peter. 17 Then the woman-servant who kept the door says to Peter, "Are you not also one of this man's disciples?" He says, "I am not." 18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals (for it was cold), and they warmed themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.

19 The high priest then asked Jesus concerning his disciples and concerning his doctrine. 20 Jesus answered him, "[.woc]#I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple where the Jews always resort, and in secret I have said nothing.# 21 [.woc]#Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard me what I have said to them. Behold, they know what I have said.#" 22 And when he had said this, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, "Do you answer the high priest like that?" 23 Jesus answered him, "[.woc]#If I have spoken evil, bear testimony of the evil. But if rightly, why do you smite me?#" 24 (Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.)

25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore to him, "Are you not also one of his disciples?" He denied it, and said, "I am not." 26 One of the servants of the high priest (being the kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off) says, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?" 27 Peter then denied again, and immediately the cock crowed.

28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment. And it was early, and they themselves did not go into the judgment-hall so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. 29 Pilate then went out to them, and said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?" 30 They answered and said to him, "If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to you." 31 Then Pilate said to them, "Take him and judge him according to your law." The Jews therefore said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put any man to death," 32 So that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die.

33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment-hall again and called Jesus and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" 34 Jesus answered him, "[.woc]#Do you say this thing from yourself, or did others tell it to you concerning me?#" 35 Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?" 36 Jesus answered, "[.woc]#My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight so that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.#" 37 Pilate therefore said to him, "Are you a King then?" Jesus answered, "[.woc]#You say that I am a King. To this end I was born, and for this cause I came into the world, so that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.#" 38 Pilate says to him, "What is truth?" And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and says to them, "I find in him no fault. 39 But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the passover. Do you therefore wish that I release to you the King of the Jews?" 40 Then they all cried again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas." (Now Barabbas was a robber.)

=== Chapter 19

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ is scourged, crowned with thorns, and beaten, 1-3. Pilate is desirous to release him, but being overcome with the outrage of the Jews, he delivers him to be crucified, 4-22. They cast lots for his garments, 23, 24. He commends his mother to John, 25-27. He dies, 28-30. His side is pierced, 31-37. He is buried by Joseph and Nicodemus, 38-42._

1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged him. 2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him, 3 And said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they smote him with their hands. 4 Pilate therefore went forth again, and says to them, "Behold, I bring him forth to you so that you may know that I find no fault in him." 5 Then Jesus came forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate says to them, "Behold the man!" 6 Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify him. Crucify him." Pilate says to them, "Take him and crucify him, for I find no fault in him." 7 The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God."

8 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid, 9 And went again into the judgment-hall and says to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer. 10 Then Pilate says to him, "Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to crucify you and power to release you?" 11 Jesus answered, "[.woc]#You could have no power against me unless it were given to you from above. Therefore, he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.#" 12 And from thereafter, Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king, speaks against Caesar."

13 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth and sat down on the judgment-seat in a place that is called The Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. 14 And it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, "Behold your King!" 15 But they cried out, "Away with him. Away with him. Crucify him." Pilate says to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."

16 So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led him away.

17 And he, bearing his cross, went forth into a place called The Place of a Skull (which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha). 18 There they crucified him, and two others with him, one on each side and Jesus in the midst. 19 And Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS." 20 Many of the Jews then read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. 21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'He said, "I am King of the Jews."'" 22 Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."

23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. [[jhn019-024]]24 Therefore, they said among themselves, "Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it shall be," so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|"_They parted my clothing among them,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and for my vesture they cast lots._"

Therefore the soldiers did these things. 25 Now standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by, he says to his mother, "[.woc]#Woman, behold your son!#" 27 Then he says to the disciple, "[.woc]#Behold your mother!#" And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.

28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, says, "[.woc]#I thirst.#" 29 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar. And they filled a sponge with vinegar, put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. 30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "[.woc]#It is finished,#" and he bowed his head and expired.

31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, so that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a high day), implored Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. 32 Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him. 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 34 But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 35 And he who saw it, testified—and his testimony is true, and he knows that he speaks truth—so that you may believe. [[jhn019-036]]36 For these things were done so that the Scripture should be fulfilled: "_A bone of him shall not be broken._" [[jhn019-037]]37 And again another Scripture says, "_They shall look at him whom they pierced._"

38 And after this, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) petitioned Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him leave. He therefore came and took the body of Jesus. 39 And Nicodemus (who at the first came to Jesus by night) also came and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds in weight. 40 Then they took the body of Jesus and wound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the manner of the Jews for burial. 41 Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulcher in which no man had ever yet laid. 42 Therefore, because of the Jews' preparation-day and because the sepulcher was near at hand, they laid Jesus there.

_Mary comes to the sepulcher, 1, 2; so do Peter and John, ignorant of the resurrection, 3-10. Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene, 11-18, and to his disciples, 19-23. The incredulity and confession of Thomas, 24-29. These written signs are sufficient for salvation, 30, 31._

1 On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene comes to the sepulcher early, when it was still dark, and sees the stone taken away from the sepulcher. 2 Then she runs and comes to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and says to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher and we do not know where they have laid him." 3 Therefore, Peter and that other disciple went forth and came to the sepulcher. 4 And they both ran together, but the other disciple outran Peter and came to the sepulcher first. 5 And he, stooping down, saw the linen cloths lying, yet he did not go in. 6 Then Simon Peter comes following him and went into the sepulcher and sees the linen cloths lying, 7 And the cloth that was around his head not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by itself. 8 Then that other disciple who came first to the sepulcher also went in, and he saw and believed. 9 For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. 10 Then the disciples went away back to their own home.

11 But Mary stood outside at the sepulcher weeping. And as she wept, she stooped down to look into the sepulcher, 12 And sees two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 13 And they say to her, "Woman, why do you weep?" She says to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid him." 14 And when she had said this, she turned herself around and saw Jesus standing, and did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus says to her, "[.woc]#Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek?#" She, supposing him to be the gardener, says to him, "Sir, if you have carried him from here, tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away." 16 Jesus says to her, "[.woc]#Mary.#" She turned herself and says to him, "Rabboni," (which is to say, Master). 17 Jesus says to her, "[.woc]#Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, 'I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.'#" 18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things to her.

19 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and says to them, "[.woc]#Peace be to you.#" 20 And when he had said this, he showed his hands and his side to them. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. 21 Then Jesus said to them again, "[.woc]#Peace be to you. As my Father has sent me, even so I send you.#" 22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and says to them, "[.woc]#Receive the Holy Spirit.# 23 [.woc]#If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven, and if you retain the sins of anyone, they are retained.#"

24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples therefore said to him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe."

26 And after eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas with them. Then Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, "[.woc]#Peace be to you.#" 27 Then he says to Thomas, "[.woc]#Reach here with your finger, and behold my hands. And reach here with your hand and thrust it into my side. And do not be faithless, but believing.#" 28 And Thomas answered and said to him, "My Lord and my God." 29 Jesus says to him, "[.woc]#Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.#"

30 And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book. 31 But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life through his name.

_Christ, appearing again to his disciples, is made known to them by the great multitude of fish caught in the net, 1-11. He dines with them, 12-14; earnestly commands Peter to feed his lambs and sheep, 15-17; foretells him of his death, 18-21; rebukes his curiosity concerning John, 22, 23. The conclusion, 24, 25._

1 After these things, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias, and in this manner he showed himself:

2 Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. 3 Simon Peter says to them, "I am going fishing." They say to him, "We also will go with you." They went forth and entered into a boat immediately. And that night they caught nothing.

4 But when the morning had already come, Jesus stood on the shore. But the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 Then Jesus says to them, "[.woc]#Children, do you have any food?#" They answered him, "No." 6 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you shall find some.#" They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fish. 7 Therefore, that disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter, "It is the Lord." Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt on his fisher's coat (for he was unclad) and cast himself into the sea. 8 And the other disciples came in a little boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fish.

9 Then as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there with fish laid upon them and also bread. 10 Jesus says to them, "[.woc]#Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.#" 11 Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fish—one hundred and fifty-three. And even though there were so many, yet the net was not broken.

12 Jesus says to them, "[.woc]#Come and dine.#" And none of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" knowing that it was the Lord. 13 Jesus then comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and likewise the fish. 14 This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.

15 So when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, "[.woc]#Simon son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?#" He says to him, "Yes, Lord. You know that I love you." He says to him, "[.woc]#Feed my lambs.#" 16 He says to him again the second time, "[.woc]#Simon son of Jonah, do you love me?#" He says to him, "Yes, Lord. You know that I love you." He says to him, "[.woc]#Feed my sheep.#" 17 He says to him the third time, "[.woc]#Simon son of Jonah, do you love me?#" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" And he said to him, "Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you." Jesus says to him, "[.woc]#Feed my sheep.# 18 [.woc]#Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you girt yourself and walked where you wished, but when you are old, you shall stretch forth your hands and another shall gird you and carry you where you do not wish.#" 19 He spoke this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he says to him, "[.woc]#Follow me.#"

20 Then Peter, turning around, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following (who also leaned on his chest at supper and said, "Lord, who is he who betrays you?"). 21 Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, "Lord, and what shall this man do?" 22 Jesus says to him, "[.woc]#If I wish that he remains until I come, what is that to you? Follow me.#" 23 Then this saying went abroad among the brothers, that this disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he shall not die, but, "If I wish that he remains until I come, what is that to you?"

24 This is the disciple who testifies about these things and wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.

25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should all be written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.
