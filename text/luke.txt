=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_The preface of Luke to his whole gospel, 1-4. The conception of John the Baptist, 5-25; and of Christ, 26-38. The prophecy of Elizabeth and of Mary concerning Christ, 39-56. The nativity and circumcision of John, 57-66. The prophecy of Zechariah, both of Christ, 67-75, and of John, 76-80._

1 Because many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, 2 Even as they delivered them to us, who, from the beginning, were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word, 3 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus, 4 So that you may know the certainty of those things in which you have been instructed.

5 There was in the days of Herod the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zechariah, of the course of Abia. And his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. 7 And they had no child because Elizabeth was barren and they were both far advanced in years.

8 And it came to pass, that, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, 9 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense. 11 And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. 12 And when Zechariah saw him, he was troubled and fear fell upon him. 13 But the angel said to him, "Do not fear, Zechariah, for your prayer is heard. Your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. 14 And you shall have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth, 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord. He shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. 16 And many of the children of Israel he shall turn to the Lord their God. [[luk001-017]]17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to '_turn the hearts of the fathers to the children_' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."

18 And Zechariah said to the angel, "By what shall I know this? For I am an old man and my wife is far advanced in years." 19 And the angel, answering, said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and am sent to speak to you and to show you these glad tidings. 20 And behold, you shall be mute and not able to speak until the day that these things are performed because you do not believe my words which shall be fulfilled in their season."

21 And the people waited for Zechariah and marveled that he delayed so long in the temple. 22 And when he came out, he could not speak to them. And they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he beckoned to them and remained speechless. 23 And it came to pass, that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

24 And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived and secluded herself five months, saying, 25 "Thus the Lord has dealt with me in the days in which he looked at me to take away my reproach among men."

26 And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. 28 And the angel came to her, and said, "Hail, you who are highly favored. The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women." 29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying and considered what kind of salutation this might be. 30 And the angel said to her, "Do not fear, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 And behold, you shall conceive in your womb and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David. 33 And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end." 34 Then Mary said to the angel, "How shall this be, seeing I do not know a man?" 35 And the angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore also, the holy one being born shall be called the Son of God. 36 And behold, your cousin Elizabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. 37 For with God nothing will be impossible." 38 And Mary said, "Behold the servant of the Lord, may it be done to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her.

39 And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill-country with haste to a city of Judah, 40 And entered into the house of Zechariah and saluted Elizabeth. 41 And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 42 And she spoke with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. 43 And how has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 44 For behold, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy. 45 And blessed is she who believed that there will be a performance of those things which were told to her from the Lord."

46 And Mary said,

will call me blessed.

56 And Mary stayed with her about three months and returned to her own house.

57 Now Elizabeth's full time came that she should deliver, and she brought forth a son. 58 And her neighbors and her cousins heard that the Lord had shown great mercy upon her, and they rejoiced with her.

59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him Zechariah, after the name of his father. 60 And his mother answered and said, "Not so, but he shall be called John." 61 And they said to her, "There is no one of your kindred who is called by this name." 62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. 63 And he asked for a writing-tablet, and wrote, saying, "His name is John." And they all wondered. 64 And his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosened, and he spoke and praised God. 65 And fear came on all who dwelt around them, and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill-country of Judea. 66 And all those who had heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, "What manner of child this will be!" And the hand of the Lord was with him.

67 And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|
|68 "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
for he has visited and redeemed his people.

in the house of his servant David,

|
|70 As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, [.linebr]#/# +
who have been since the world began,

|
|[[luk001-071]]71 That we should be '_saved from our enemies,_ [.linebr]#/# +
_and from the hand of all who hate us,_'

|
|72 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, [.linebr]#/# +
and to remember his holy covenant,

|
|73 The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,

|
|74 That he would grant to us, that we, [.linebr]#/# +
being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, [.linebr]#/# +
might serve him without fear,

|
|75 In holiness and righteousness before him, [.linebr]#/# +
all the days of our life.

|
|[[luk001-076]]76 And you, child, shall be called [.linebr]#/# +
the prophet of the Highest, [.linebr]#/# +
for you shall '_go before the face of the Lord_ [.linebr]#/# +
_to prepare his ways,_'

|
|77 To give knowledge of salvation to his people, [.linebr]#/# +
by the remission of their sins,

|
|78 Through the tender mercy of our God, [.linebr]#/# +
by which the day-spring from on high has visited us,

_and in the shadow of death,_' [.linebr]#/# +
to guide our feet into the way of peace."

80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit and was in the wilderness until the day of his showing to Israel.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_Augustus taxes all the Roman empire, 1-5. The nativity of Christ, 6, 7 An angel relates it to the shepherds, and many sing praises to God for it, 8-14. The shepherds glorify God, 15-20. Christ is circumcised, 21. Mary purified, 22-24. Simeon and Anna prophesy of Christ, 25-38, who increases in wisdom, 39, 40, questions in the temple with the teachers, 41-50, and is obedient to his parents, 51, 52._

1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. 2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) 3 And all went to be taxed, each into his own city. 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he was of the house and lineage of David), 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. 6 And so it was, that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should deliver. 7 And she brought forth her first-born son, wrapped him in swaddling-clothes, and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the guest-chamber.

8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9 And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were in great fear. 10 And the angel said to them, "Do not fear, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be for all people. 11 For there is born to you this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12 And this shall be a sign for you: you shall find the baby wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger." 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|
|14 "Glory to God in the highest, [.linebr]#/# +
and on earth peace, good will toward men."

15 And it came to pass, when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us now go even to Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us." 16 And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. 17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told to them concerning this child. 18 And all those who heard it wondered at those things which were told to them by the shepherds. 19 But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told to them.

21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, who was thus named by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

22 And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord [[luk002-023]]23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, "_Every male who is the first-born of his mother shall be called holy to the Lord_"), [[luk002-024]]24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord: "_A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons._"

25 And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was upon him. 26 And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. 27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, 28 He took him up in his arms and blessed God, and said,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|
|29 "Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, [.linebr]#/# +
according to your word.

|
|30 For my eyes have seen your salvation,

|
|31 Which you have prepared [.linebr]#/# +
before the face of all people,

|
|[[luk002-032]]32 '_A light to enlighten the Gentiles,_' [.linebr]#/# +
and the glory of your people Israel."

33 And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken concerning him. 34 And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, "Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against 35 (And a sword shall pierce through your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."

36 And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, 37 And she was a widow of about eighty-four years. She did not depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day. 38 And she, coming in that instant, gave thanks likewise to the Lord and spoke of him to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem.

39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee to their own city of Nazareth. 40 And the child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom. And the grace of God was upon him.

41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. 43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother did not know of it. 44 But they, supposing him to be in the company, went a day's journey, and they sought him among their relatives and acquaintances. 45 And when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem seeking him. 46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and asking them questions. 47 And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. 48 And when they saw him, they were amazed. And his mother said to him, "Son, why have you thus dealt with us? Behold, your father and I have sought you sorrowing." 49 And he said to them, "[.woc]#How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be about my Father's business?#" 50 And they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them. 51 And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. But his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man.

_The preaching and baptism of John, 1-14; his testimony of Christ, 15-18; Herod imprisons John, 19, 20; Christ, baptized, receives testimony from heaven, 21, 22. The age and genealogy of Christ showing him to be the Son of God and Son of man, 23-38._

1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanius the tetrarch of Abilene, 2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. 3 And he came into all the country around the Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, [[luk003-004]]4 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying,

7 Then he said to the multitude who came forth to be baptized by him, "O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father.' For I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. 9 And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore which does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire."

10 And the people asked him, saying, "What shall we do then?" 11 He answers and says to them, "He who has two coats, let him impart to him who has none, and he who has provisions, let him do likewise." 12 Then tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, "Master, what shall we do?" 13 And he said to them, "Exact no more than that which is appointed you." 14 And the soldiers likewise asked him, saying, "And what shall we do?" And he said to them, "Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages."

15 And as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts concerning John, whether he was the Christ or not, 16 John answered, saying to them all, "I indeed baptize you with water, but one mightier than I comes, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire, 17 Whose winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and will gather the wheat into his granary, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire."

18 And many other things in his exhortation he preached to the people. 19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, 20 Added yet this above all, that he shut John up in prison.

21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, as Jesus had also been baptized and was praying, that the heaven was opened, 22 And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, "You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased."

23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was the son of Heli, 24 Who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi, who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Janna, who was the son of Joseph, 25 Who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Amos, who was the son of Nahum, who was the son of Esli, who was the son of Naggai, 26 Who was the son of Maath, who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Semein, who was the son of Josech, who was the son of Joda, 27 Who was the son of Joanan, who was the son of Rhesa, who was the son of Zerubbabel, who was the son of Shealtiel, who was the son of Neri, 28 Who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Addi, who was the son of Cosam, who was the son of Elmadam, who was the son of Er, 29 Who was the son of Joshua, who was the son of Eliezer, who was the son of Jorim, who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi, 30 Who was the son of Simeon, who was the son of Judah, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Jonam, who was the son of Eliakim, 31 Who was the son of Melea, who was the son of Menna, who was the son of Mattatha, who was the son of Nathan, who was the son of David, 32 Who was the son of Jesse, who was the son of Obed, who was the son of Boaz, who was the son of Salmon, who was the son of Nahshon, 33 Who was the son of Amminadab, who was the son of Ram, who was the son of Hezron, who was the son of Pharez, who was the son of Judah, 34 Who was the son of Jacob, who was the son of Isaac, who was the son of Abraham, who was the son of Terah, who was the son of Nahor, 35 Who was the son of Serug, who was the son of Reu, who was the son of Peleg, who was the son of Eber, who was the son of Salah, 36 Who was the son of Cainan, who was the son of Arphaxad, who was the son of Shem, who was the son of Noah, who was the son of Lamech, 37 Who was the son of Methuselah, who was the son of Enoch, who was the son of Jared, who was the son of Mahalaleel, who was the son of Cainan, 38 Who was the son of Enos, who was the son of Seth, who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God.

_The temptation and fasting of Christ, 1-13. He begins to preach, 14, 15. The people of Nazareth admire his gracious words, but being offended, seek to kill him, 16-32. He cures someone possessed with a demon, 33-37, Peter's mother-in-law, 38, 39, and various other sick persons, 40. The demons acknowledge Christ and are reproved for it, 41. He preaches through the cities of Galilee, 42-44._

1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 2 Being forty days tempted by the devil. And in those days he ate nothing, and when they had ended, he was afterward hungry. 3 And the devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread." [[luk004-004]]4 And Jesus answered him, saying, "[.woc]#It is written, '_Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God._'#"

5 And the devil taking him up upon a high mountain showed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 6 And the devil said to him, "All this power I will give you, and the glory of them, for that is delivered to me, and to whomever I wish, I give it. 7 If you therefore will worship me, all shall be yours." [[luk004-008]]8 And Jesus answered and said to him, "[.woc]#Get behind me, Satan, for it is written, '_You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only._'#"

9 And he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, "If you are the son of God, cast yourself down from here, [[luk004-010]]10 For it is written,

14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee. And there went out a fame of him through all the surrounding region. 15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath and stood up to read. 17 And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,

20 And he closed the book, gave it back to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all those who were in the synagogue were fastened on him. 21 And he began to say to them, "[.woc]#This day this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears.#" 22 And all bore him testimony and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, "Is this not Joseph's son?" 23 And he said to them, "[.woc]#You will surely say to me this proverb, 'Physician, heal yourself. Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do here in your country also.'#" 24 And he said, "[.woc]#Truly I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country.# 25 [.woc]#But I tell you in truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah when the heaven was shut three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land.# 26 [.woc]#But Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, a city of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.# 27 [.woc]#And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.#" 28 And all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath. 29 And they rose up, thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built so that they might cast him down headlong. 30 But he, passing through the midst of them, went away.

31 And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath-days. 32 And they were astonished at his doctrine, for his word was with power. 33 And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, 34 Saying, "Leave us alone. What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God." 35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "[.woc]#Hold your peace and come out of him.#" And when the demon had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him and did not hurt him. 36 And they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, "What a word this is! For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out." 37 And the fame of him went out into every place of the surrounding country.

38 And he arose out of the synagogue and entered into Simon's house. And the mother of Simon's wife was taken with a violent fever, and they implored him for her. 39 And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and ministered to them.

40 Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him. And he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. 41 And demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, "You are Christ the Son of God." And rebuking them, he did not allow them to speak, for they knew that he was Christ.

42 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place. And the people sought him, came to him, and wanted to keep him so that he would not depart from them. 43 And he said to them, "[.woc]#I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also, for that is why I am sent.#"

44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ teaches the people out of Peter's ship, 1-3; in a miraculous taking of fish, shows how he will make him and his partners fishers of men, 4-11; cleanses the leper, 12-15; prays in the wilderness, 16; heals someone of paralysis, 17-26; calls Matthew the tax collector, 27, 28; eats with sinners, as being the physician of souls, 29-32; foretells the fastings and afflictions of the apostles after his ascension, 33-35; and illustrates the matter by the parable of old bottles and worn garments, 36-39._

1 And it came to pass, that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, 2 And saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. 3 And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people out of the boat. 4 Now when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "[.woc]#Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.#" 5 And Simon, answering, said to him, "Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing. Nevertheless, at your word I will let down the net." 6 And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish and their net broke. 7 And they beckoned to their partners who were in the other boat that they should come and help them. And they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink. 8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." 9 For he was astonished, along with all who were with him, at the catch of the fish which they had taken, 10 And so were James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "[.woc]#Do not fear. From now on you shall catch men.#" 11 And when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed him.

12 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold, a man full of leprosy, who, seeing Jesus, fell on his face and implored him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." 13 And he put forth his hand and touched him, saying, "[.woc]#I am willing. Be clean.#" And immediately the leprosy departed from him. 14 And he charged him, "[.woc]#Tell no man. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according as Moses commanded for a testimony to them.#" 15 But so much the more a fame of him went abroad, and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities. 16 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed.

17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal [the sick]. 18 And behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed. And they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him. 19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went upon the house-top and let him down through the tiling with his bed into the midst before Jesus. 20 And when he saw their faith, he said to him, "[.woc]#Man, your sins are forgiven.#" 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he, answering, said to them, "[.woc]#What do you reason in your hearts?# 23 [.woc]#Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?# 24 [.woc]#But so that you may know that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins#"—he said to the paralytic—"[.woc]#I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go into your house.#" 25 And immediately he arose before them, took up that on which he lay, and departed to his own house glorifying God. 26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things today."

27 And after these things, he went forth and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the receipt of custom. And he said to him, "[.woc]#Follow me.#" 28 And he left everything, arose, and followed him.

29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house, and there was a great company of tax collectors and of others who sat down with them. 30 But the scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?" 31 And Jesus, answering, said to them, "[.woc]#Those who are well do not need a physician, but those who are sick do.# 32 [.woc]#I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.#"

33 And they said to him, "Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?" 34 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?# 35 [.woc]#But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days.#" 36 And he also spoke a parable to them: "[.woc]#No man puts a patch of a new garment upon an old, or else the new makes a rent and the piece that was taken out of the new does not agree with the old.# 37 [.woc]#And no man puts new wine into old bottles, or else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles will perish.# 38 [.woc]#But new wine must be put into new bottles, and both are preserved.# 39 [.woc]#No man also having drank old wine immediately desires new, because he says, 'The old is better.'#"

_Christ reproves the Pharisees, 1-11; chooses apostles, 12-16; heals the diseased, 17-19; preaches to his disciples before the people, 20-49._

1 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through grain-fields, and his disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands. 2 And some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath-days?" 3 And Jesus, answering them, said, "[.woc]#Have you not read so much as this, what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him,# 4 [.woc]#How he went into the house of God, took and ate the show-bread, and also gave to those who were with him, which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?#" 5 And he said to them, "[.woc]#The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.#"

6 And it also came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man whose right hand was withered. 7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him to see whether he would heal on the sabbath so that they might find an accusation against him. 8 But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, "[.woc]#Rise and stand forth in the midst.#" And he arose and stood forth. 9 Then Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#I will ask you one thing: is it lawful on the sabbath-days to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?#" 10 And looking around at them all, he said to the man, "[.woc]#Stretch forth your hand.#" And he did so and his hand was restored whole as the other. 11 And they were filled with madness and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.

12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out to a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God. 13 And when it was day, he called his disciples to him, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named Apostles: 14 Simon (whom he also named Peter) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, 15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, Simon called Zelotes, 16 Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot (who also was the traitor).

17 And he came down with them and stood in the plain, with the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all Judea, Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, 18 And also those who were afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were healed. 19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him, for power went out of him and healed them all.

20 And he lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, "[.woc]#Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.# 21 [.woc]#Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.# 22 [.woc]#Blessed are you when men hate you and when they separate you from their company, reproach you, and cast out your name as evil on account of the Son of man.# 23 [.woc]#Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For their fathers did likewise to the prophets.# 24 [.woc]#But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.# 25 [.woc]#Woe to you who are full! For you shall hunger. Woe to you who laugh now! For you shall mourn and weep.# 26 [.woc]#Woe to you, when all men speak well of you! For thus their fathers did to the false prophets.#

27 "[.woc]#But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,# 28 [.woc]#Bless those who curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you.# 29 [.woc]#And to him who smites you on one cheek, offer the other also. And to him who takes away your cloak, do not forbid to take your coat also.# 30 [.woc]#Give to every man who asks of you, and of him who takes away your goods, do not ask for them back.# 31 [.woc]#And as you wish that men should do to you, do also to them likewise.# 32 [.woc]#For if you love those who love you, what thanks do you have? For sinners also love those who love them.# 33 [.woc]#And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks do you have? For sinners even do the same.# 34 [.woc]#And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks do you have? For sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much in return.# 35 [.woc]#But love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing back, and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest, for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.# 36 [.woc]#Therefore, be merciful, as your Father is also merciful.#

37 "[.woc]#Do not judge, and you shall not be judged. Do not condemn, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.# 38 [.woc]#Give, and it shall be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, men shall give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you give to others, it shall be measured back to you."#

39 And he spoke a parable to them: "[.woc]#Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch?# 40 [.woc]#The disciple is not above his master, but everyone who is perfect shall be as his master.# 41 [.woc]#And why do you behold the mote that is in your brother's eye, but not perceive the beam that is in your own eye?# 42 [.woc]#Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not behold the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to pull out the mote that is in your brother's eye.# 43 [.woc]#For a good tree does not bring forth corrupt fruit, neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.# 44 [.woc]#For every tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.# 45 [.woc]#A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil. For from the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.#

46 "[.woc]#And why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do the things which I say?# 47 [.woc]#Whoever comes to me, hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.# 48 [.woc]#He is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock, and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it, for it was founded upon a rock.# 49 [.woc]#But he who hears and does not do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream beat vehemently and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.#"

=== Chapter 7

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ finds a greater faith in the centurion, a Gentile, than in any of the Jews, 1-9; heals his servant, being absent, 10; raises from death the widow's son at Nain, 11-17; answers John's messengers with the declaration of his miracles, 18-23; testifies to the people what opinion he held of John, 24-30; gives reproof to the Jews, with neither the manners of John nor of Jesus, of who could be won, 31-35; and allowing his feet to be washed and anointed by a woman who was a sinner, he shows how he is a friend to sinners, to forgive them of their sins upon their repentance, 36-50._

1 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

2 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die. 3 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent the elders of the Jews to him imploring him that he would come and heal his servant. 4 And when they came to Jesus, they implored him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy for you to do this, 5 For he loves our nation and has built us a synagogue." 6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof; 7 Therefore, neither did I think myself worthy to come to you. But say in a word and my servant shall be healed. 8 For I also am a man set under authority and have under me soldiers. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." 9 When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him and turned himself around and said to the people who followed him, "[.woc]#I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel.#" 10 And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.

11 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain, and many of his disciples went with him, along with many people. 12 Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and many people of the city were with her. 13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, "[.woc]#Do not weep.#" 14 And he came and touched the bier. And those who bore him stood still. And he said, "[.woc]#Young man, I say to you, arise.#" 15 And he who was dead sat up and began to speak, and he delivered him to his mother. 16 And there came a fear on all and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has risen among us," and, "God has visited his people." 17 And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judea and throughout all the neighboring region.

18 And the disciples of John informed him of all these things. 19 And John, calling two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are you he who should come? Or do we look for another?" 20 When the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you he who should come, or do we look for another?'" 21 And in that same hour he cured many of infirmities, diseases, and evil spirits, and to many who were blind he gave sight. [[luk007-022]]22 Then Jesus, answering, said to them, "[.woc]#Go, and tell John what things you have seen and heard: '_the blind see,_' '_the lame walk,_' lepers are cleansed, '_the deaf hear,_' the dead are raised, and '_the gospel is preached to the poor._'# 23 [.woc]#And blessed is he to whom I shall not be a stumbling block.#"

24 And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, "[.woc]#What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?# 25 [.woc]#But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously appareled and live delicately are in kings' courts.# 26 [.woc]#But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.# [[luk007-027]]27 "[.woc]#This is he concerning whom it is written,#

28 "[.woc]#For I say to you, among those who are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.#" 29 And all the people and the tax collectors who heard him justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. 30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves by not being baptized by him.

31 And the Lord said, "[.woc]#To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? And to what are they like?# 32 [.woc]#They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling to one another, and saying,#

36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house and sat down at the table. 37 And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster vial of ointment, 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears, then wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. 39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is who touches him, for she is a sinner."

40 And Jesus, answering, said to him, "[.woc]#Simon, I have something to say to you.#" And he says, "Master, speak." 41 "[.woc]#There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.# 42 [.woc]#And when they had nothing to pay, he freely forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?#" 43 Simon answered and said, "I suppose the one whom he forgave most." And he said to him, "[.woc]#You have rightly judged.#" 44 And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, "[.woc]#Do you see this woman? I entered into your house and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.# 45 [.woc]#You gave me no kiss, but this woman, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.# 46 [.woc]#You did not anoint my head with oil, but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.# 47 [.woc]#Therefore, I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.#" 48 And he said to her, "[.woc]#Your sins are forgiven.#" 49 And those who sat at the table with him began to say within themselves, "Who is this who forgives sins also?" 50 And he said to the woman, "[.woc]#Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.#"

[.outline.text-center]
_Women minister to Christ from their substance, 1-3. Christ, after he had preached from place to place, attended by his apostles, propounds the parable of the sower, 4-15, and of the candle, 16-18; declares who are his mother and brothers, 19-21; rebukes the winds, 22-25; casts the legion of demons out of the man into the herd of swine, 26-36; is rejected by the Gadarenes, 37-42; heals the woman of her bloody issue, 43-48; and raises from death Jairus's daughter, 49-56._

1 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him, 2 Along with some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary called Magdalene (out of whom went seven demons), 3 Joanna (the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward), Susanna, and many others who ministered to him from their possessions.

4 And when many people were collected and had come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable: 5 "[.woc]#A sower went out to sow his seed, and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it was trodden down and the birds of the air devoured it.# 6 [.woc]#And some fell upon a rock, and as soon as it had sprung up, it withered because it lacked moisture.# 7 [.woc]#And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.# 8 [.woc]#And others fell on good ground, sprang up, and bore fruit one hundred-fold.#" And when he had said these things, he cried, "[.woc]#He who has ears to hear, let him hear.#"

9 And his disciples asked him, saying, "What does this parable mean?" [[luk008-010]]10 And he said, "[.woc]#To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to others in parables so that '_seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand._'#

11 "[.woc]#Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.# 12 [.woc]#Those by the wayside are those who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.# 13 [.woc]#Those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. But these have no root, who for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away.# 14 [.woc]#And that which fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection.# 15 [.woc]#But those on the good ground are those, who, in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it and bring forth fruit with patience.#

16 "[.woc]#No man, when he has lit a candle, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but sets it on a candlestick so that those who enter in may see the light.# 17 [.woc]#For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, neither anything hid that shall not be known and come abroad.# 18 [.woc]#Take heed therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him shall be given, and whoever does not have, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.#"

19 Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but could not come near to him because of the crowd. 20 And it was told to him by some, who said, "Your mother and your brothers stand outside desiring to see you." 21 And he answered and said to them, "[.woc]#My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God, and do it.#"

22 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, "[.woc]#Let us go over to the other side of the lake.#" And they launched forth. 23 But as they sailed, he fell asleep. And there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filled with water and were in jeopardy. 24 And they came to him and awoke him, saying, "Master, master, we perish." Then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. Then they ceased, and there was a calm. 25 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Where is your faith?#" And they, being afraid, wondered, saying to one another, "What manner of man is this? For he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him."

26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee. 27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man who had demons for a long time and wore no clothes, neither stayed in any house, but in the tombs. 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of God most high? I implore you to not torment me." 29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For often it had caught him, and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters, and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.) 30 And Jesus asked him, saying, "[.woc]#What is your name?#" And he said, "Legion," because many demons had entered into him. 31 And they implored him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.

32 Now there was a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. And they implored him that he would allow them to enter into them. And he allowed them. 33 Then the demons went out of the man and entered into the swine. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked.

34 When those who fed them saw what was done, they fled and went and told it in the city and in the country. 35 Then they went out to see what was done, and came to Jesus and found the man out of whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. 36 Those who saw it also told them by what means he who was possessed by the demons was healed. 37 Then the whole multitude of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes implored him to depart from them, for they were taken with great fear. And he went into the boat and returned. 38 Now the man out of whom the demons had departed implored him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, 39 "[.woc]#Return to your own house and show what great things God has done to you.#" And he went away and published throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done to him.

40 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had returned, the people gladly received him, for they were all waiting for him. 41 And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at the feet of Jesus and implored him that he would come into his house. 42 For he had only one daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he was going, the people thronged him.

43 And a woman having an issue of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed by any, 44 Came behind him and touched the border of his garment, and immediately her issue of blood stanched. 45 And Jesus said, "[.woc]#Who touched me?#" When all denied, Peter, and those who were with him, said, "Master, the multitude throngs you and presses you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'" 46 And Jesus said, "[.woc]#Somebody has touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out of me.#" 47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared to him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately. 48 And he said to her, "[.woc]#Daughter, be of good comfort. Your faith has made you whole. Go in peace.#"

49 While he was still speaking, there comes someone from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, "Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Master." 50 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, "[.woc]#Do not fear. Only believe, and she shall be healed.#" 51 And when he came into the house, he allowed no man to go in except Peter, James, John, and the father and the mother of the girl. 52 And all wept and bewailed her, but he said, "[.woc]#Do not weep. She is not dead, but sleeps.#" 53 And they derided him, knowing that she was dead. 54 And he put them all out and took her by the hand and called, saying, "[.woc]#Girl, arise.#" 55 And her spirit came back, and she arose immediately. Then he commanded them to give her food. 56 And her parents were astonished, but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.

=== Chapter 9

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ sends his apostles to work miracles and to preach, 1-6. Herod desires to see Christ, 7-9. The apostles return, 10, 11. Christ feeds five thousand, 12-17; inquires what opinion the world had of him; foretells his passion, 18-22; proposes to all the pattern of his patience, 23-27. The transfiguration, 28-36. He heals the lunatic, 37-42; again forewarns his disciples of his passion, 43-45; commends humility, 46-50; bids them to show mildness toward all without desire of revenge, 51-56. Some would follow him, but upon conditions, 57-62._

1 Then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases. 2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 3 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Take nothing for your journey, neither staffs, nor bag, neither bread, neither money, neither have two coats apiece.# 4 [.woc]#And into whatever house you enter, abide there, and from there depart.# 5 [.woc]#And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.#" 6 And they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.

7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him. And he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, 8 And by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the ancient prophets had risen again. 9 And Herod said, "I have beheaded John, but who is this of whom I hear such things?" And he desired to see him.

10 And the apostles, when they had returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them and went aside privately into a desolate place, belonging to the city called Bethsaida. 11 And the people, when they knew it, followed him. And he received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God and healed those who had need of healing.

12 And when the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to him, "Send the multitude away so that they may go into the towns and country around and lodge and get food, for we are here in a desolate place." 13 But he said to them, "[.woc]#You give them something to eat.#" And they said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy provisions for all this people." 14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, "[.woc]#Make them sit down by fifties in a company.#" 15 And they did so, and made them all sit down. 16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude. 17 And they ate and were all satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets of fragments that remained.

18 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him, and he asked them, saying, "[.woc]#Who do the people say that I am?#" 19 They, answering, said, "'John the Baptist,' but some say, 'Elijah,' and others say, 'One of the ancient prophets has risen again.'" 20 He said to them, "[.woc]#But who do you say that I am?#" Peter, answering, said, "Christ of God." 21 And he strictly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thing, 22 Saying, "[.woc]#The Son of man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be put to death, and be raised on the third day.#"

23 And he said to them all, "[.woc]#If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.# 24 [.woc]#For whoever will save his life shall lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.# 25 [.woc]#For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world and loses himself or is cast away?# 26 [.woc]#For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his own glory, and in that of his Father and of the holy angels.# 27 [.woc]#But I tell you in truth, there are some standing here who shall not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.#"

28 And it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings, he took Peter, John, and James and went up upon a mountain to pray. 29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered and his clothing was white and glistening. 30 And behold, two men talked with him who were Moses and Elijah, 31 Who appeared in glory and spoke about his departure which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. 32 But Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, and when they were awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. 33 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing what he said. 34 While he was thus speaking, there came a cloud and overshadowed them, and they feared as they entered into the cloud. 35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son. Hear him." 36 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.

37 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they had come down from the hill, many people met him. 38 And behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, "Master, I implore you to look upon my son, for he is my only child. 39 And behold, a spirit takes him and he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and bruising him, it hardly departs from him. 40 And I implored your disciples to cast him out, but they could not." 41 And Jesus, answering, said, "[.woc]#O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.#" 42 And as he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and delivered him back to his father. 43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they were all wondering at all things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples, 44 "[.woc]#Let these sayings sink down into your ears. For the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men.#" 45 But they did not understand this saying, and it was hid from them so that they did not perceive it. And they feared to ask him concerning that saying.

46 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest. 47 And Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child and set him by him, 48 And said to them, "[.woc]#Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all, the same shall be great.#"

49 And John answered and said, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he does not follow with us." 50 And Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Do not forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.#"

51 And it came to pass, when the time had come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 52 And sent messengers before his face. And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him. 53 And they did not receive him because he was apparently going to Jerusalem. 54 And when his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, "Lord, do you wish that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did?" 55 But he turned and rebuked them, and said, "[.woc]#You do not know of what manner of spirit you are.# 56 [.woc]#For the Son of man has not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.#" And they went to another village.

57 And it came to pass, that as they were going in the way, a certain man said to him, "Lord, I will follow you wherever you go." 58 And Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.#" 59 And he said to another, "[.woc]#Follow me.#" But he said, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father." 60 Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Let the dead bury their dead, but go and preach the kingdom of God.#" 61 And another also said, "Lord, I will follow you, but first let me go bid farewell to those who are at my house." 62 And Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#No man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.#"

=== Chapter 10

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ sends out at once seventy disciples to work miracles and to preach, 1-12; pronounces a woe against certain cities, 13-16. The seventy return with joy; he shows them wherein to rejoice, and thanks his Father for his grace, 17-22; magnifies the happy estate of his church, 23, 24; teaches the lawyer how to attain eternal life and to take everyone for his neighbor who needs his mercy, 25-37; reproves Martha and commends Mary her sister, 38-42._

1 After these things, the Lord appointed another seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself would come. 2 Therefore, he said to them, "[.woc]#The harvest is truly great, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.# 3 [.woc]#Go. Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.# 4 [.woc]#Carry neither purse, nor sack, nor shoes, and salute no man along the way.# 5 [.woc]#And into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'# 6 [.woc]#And if the son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it, but if not, it shall turn back to you.# 7 [.woc]#And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give, for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not go from house to house.# 8 [.woc]#And into whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.# 9 [.woc]#And heal the sick who are therein, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'# 10 [.woc]#But into whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into the streets of the same, and say,# 11 [.woc]#'Even the very dust of your city which cleaves on us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless, be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near to you.'# 12 [.woc]#But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that city.#

13 "[.woc]#Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in you, they would have a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.# 14 [.woc]#But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.# 15 [.woc]#And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell.#

16 "[.woc]#He who hears you hears me, and he who despises you despises me, and he who despises me despises him who sent me.#"

17 And the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us through your name." 18 And he said to them, "[.woc]#I beheld Satan fall as lightning from heaven.# 19 [.woc]#Behold, I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy. And nothing shall by any means hurt you.# 20 [.woc]#Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.#"

21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit, and said, "[.woc]#I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hid these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babies. Indeed, Father, for thus it seemed good in your sight.# 22 [.woc]#All things are delivered to me by my Father. And no man knows who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son and he to whom the Son will reveal him.#"

23 And he turned himself to his disciples, and said privately, "[.woc]#Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see.# 24 [.woc]#For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them, and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them.#"

25 And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, "Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" 26 He said to him, "[.woc]#What is written in the law? How do you read it?#" [[luk010-027]]27 And answering, he said, "'_You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,_' and '_your neighbor as yourself._'" 28 And he said to him, "[.woc]#You have answered rightly. Do this, and you shall live.#" 29 But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"

30 And Jesus, answering, said, "[.woc]#A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers who stripped him of his clothing, wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.# 31 [.woc]#And by chance a certain priest came down that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.# 32 [.woc]#And likewise, a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked at him and passed by on the other side.# 33 [.woc]#But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,# 34 [.woc]#And went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.# 35 [.woc]#And on the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii and gave them to the host and said to him, 'Take care of him. And whatever more you spend, when I come back I will repay you.'# 36 [.woc]#Which now of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?#" 37 And he said, "He who showed mercy to him." Then Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Go, and do likewise.#"

38 Now it came to pass, as they were going, he entered into a certain village. And a certain woman, named Martha, received him into her house. 39 And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and heard his word. 40 But Martha was encumbered with much serving and came to him, and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore to help me." 41 And Jesus answered, and said to her, "[.woc]#Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.# 42 [.woc]#But one thing is needful, and Mary has chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her.#"

_Christ teaches to pray, and that instantly, 1-10; assuring us that God will give all good things to those who ask him, 11-13. He, casting out a mute demon, rebukes the blasphemous Pharisees, 14-26; and shows who are blessed, 27, 28; preaches to the people, 29-36; and reproves the outward show of holiness in the Pharisees, scribes, and lawyers, 37-54._

1 And it came to pass, that as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples." 2 And he said to them, "[.woc]#When you pray, say,#

5 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Which of you has a friend and goes to him at midnight and says to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves,# 6 [.woc]#For a friend of mine in his journey has come to me and I have nothing to set before him,'# 7 [.woc]#And he from within answers and says, 'Do not trouble me.

14 And he was casting out a demon, and it was mute. And it came to pass when the demon had gone out, the mute spoke, and the people wondered. 15 But some of them said, "He casts out demons through Beelzebub, the chief of the demons." 16 And others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven. 17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "[.woc]#Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls.# 18 [.woc]#If Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub.# 19 [.woc]#And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they shall be your judges.# 20 [.woc]#But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, no doubt the kingdom of God has come upon you.# 21 [.woc]#When a strong armed man keeps his palace, his goods are in peace.# 22 [.woc]#But when someone stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted and divides his plunder.# 23 [.woc]#He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.#

24 "[.woc]#When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he walks through dry places seeking rest, and finding none, he says, 'I will return to my house where I came out.'# 25 [.woc]#And when he comes, he finds it swept and garnished.# 26 [.woc]#Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. Then the last state of that man is worse than the first.#"

27 And it came to pass, as he was speaking these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts which nourished you." 28 But he said, "[.woc]#Yes, but rather blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it.#"

29 And when the people were assembled in crowds, he began to say, "[.woc]#This is an evil generation. They seek a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.# 30 [.woc]#For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of man shall be to this generation.# 31 [.woc]#The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them. For she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here.# 32 [.woc]#The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.#

33 "[.woc]#No man when he has lit a candle puts it in a secret place, neither under a basket, but on a candlestick, so that those who come in may see the light.# 34 [.woc]#The light of the body is the eye. Therefore, when your eye is single, your whole body is also full of light, but when your eye is evil, your body is also full of darkness.# 35 [.woc]#Take heed therefore that the light which is in you is not darkness.# 36 [.woc]#If your whole body therefore is full of light, having no dark part, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle gives you light.#"

37 And as he was speaking, a certain Pharisee implored him to dine with him. And he went in and sat down to eat. 38 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed before dinner. 39 And the Lord said to him, "[.woc]#Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and the platter clean, but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.# 40 [.woc]#You fools. Did he who made that which is outside not make that which is inside also?# 41 [.woc]#But rather give those things which you have on the inside as alms, and behold, all things are clean to you.#

42 "[.woc]#But woe to you, Pharisees! For you tithe mint, rue, and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God. These you ought to have done, and not to leave the others undone.# 43 [.woc]#Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets.# 44 [.woc]#Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are as graves which are unseen, and the men who walk over them are not aware of them.#"

45 Then one of the lawyers answered, and said to him, "Master, saying thus, you reproach us also." 46 And he said, "[.woc]#Woe to you also, you lawyers, for you load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.# 47 [.woc]#Woe to you! For you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.# 48 [.woc]#Truly you bear testimony that you allow the deeds of your fathers. For they indeed killed them, and you build their sepulchers.# 49 [.woc]#Therefore, the wisdom of God also said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will slay and persecute,# 50 [.woc]#So that the blood of all the prophets which has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,# 51 [.woc]#From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the temple.' Truly I say to you, it shall be required of this generation.# 52 [.woc]#Woe to you, lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You have not entered in yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering in.#"

53 And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently and to solicit him to speak of many things, 54 Lying in wait for him and seeking to catch something from his mouth so that they might accuse him.

=== Chapter 12

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ preaches to his apostles to avoid hypocrisy and fearfulness in publishing his doctrine, 1-12; warns the people to beware of covetousness by the parable of the rich man who set up greater barns, 13-21. We must not be over careful of earthly things, 22-30, but seek the kingdom of God, 31, 32; give alms, 33, 34; be ready at a knock to open to our Lord whenever he comes, 35-40. Christ's ministers are to see to their charge, 41-48, and look for persecution, 49-53. The people must take this time of grace, 54-56; because it is a fearful thing to die without reconciliation, 57-59._

1 In the mean time, when there was gathered an innumerable multitude of people so that they trod upon one another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, "[.woc]#Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.# 2 [.woc]#For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, neither hid that shall not be known.# 3 [.woc]#Therefore, whatever you have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light, and that which you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops.#

4 "[.woc]#And I say to you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.# 5 [.woc]#But I will forewarn you whom you shall fear. Fear him, who, after he has killed, has power to cast into hell. Indeed, I say to you, fear him.# 6 [.woc]#Are five sparrows not sold for two assarions? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.# 7 [.woc]#But even every hair of your head has been numbered. Do not fear therefore. You are of more value than many sparrows.#

8 "[.woc]#Also I say to you, whoever confesses me before men, the Son of man will also confess him before the angels of God.# 9 [.woc]#But he who denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.# 10 [.woc]#And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, he shall be forgiven, but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, he shall not be forgiven.# 11 [.woc]#And when they bring you to the synagogues and before magistrates and powers, do not be solicitous how or what thing you shall answer or what you shall say.# 12 [.woc]#For the Holy Spirit will teach you in the same hour what you ought to say.#"

13 And someone from the company said to him, "Master, speak to my brother so that he divides the inheritance with me." 14 And he said to him, "[.woc]#Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?#" 15 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Take heed, and beware of covetousness, for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses.#" 16 And he spoke a parable to them, saying, "[.woc]#The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully.# 17 [.woc]#And he thought within himself, saying, 'What shall I do, for I do not have room to deposit my fruits?'# 18 [.woc]#And he said, 'I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build greater ones, and there I will deposit all my fruits and my goods.# 19 [.woc]#And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have abundance of goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry."'# 20 [.woc]#But God said to him, 'You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you. Then whose shall those things be which you have provided?'# 21 [.woc]#Thus is he who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.#"

22 And he said to his disciples, "[.woc]#Therefore, I say to you, do not be anxious for your life—what you shall eat; neither for the body—what you shall put on.# 23 [.woc]#The life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.# 24 [.woc]#Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, which neither have store-house, nor barn, and God feeds them.

41 Then Peter said to him, "Lord, do you speak this parable to us, or even to all?" 42 And the Lord said, "[.woc]#Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord makes ruler over his household to give them their portion of provisions in due season?# 43 [.woc]#Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.# 44 [.woc]#In truth I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all that he has.# 45 [.woc]#But if that servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays his coming,' and begins to beat the men-servants and women-servants and to eat, drink, and to be drunken,# 46 [.woc]#The lord of that servant will come in a day when he does not look for him and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him apart and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.# 47 [.woc]#And that servant who knew his lord's will and did not prepare himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.# 48 [.woc]#But he who did not know and committed things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes.

_Christ preaches repentance upon the punishment of the Galileans and others, 1-5. The fruitless fig-tree may not stand, 6-9. He heals the crooked woman, 10-17; shows the powerful working of the word in the hearts of his chosen by the parable of the grain of mustard seed and of leaven, 18-21; exhorts to enter in at the strait gate, 22-30; and reproves Herod and Jerusalem, 31-35._

1 There were present at that season some who told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 2 And Jesus, answering, said to them, "[.woc]#Do you suppose that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans because they suffered such things?# 3 [.woc]#I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.# 4 [.woc]#Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were sinners above all men who dwelt in Jerusalem?# 5 [.woc]#I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.#"

6 He also spoke this parable: "[.woc]#A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came and sought fruit on it, and found none.# 7 [.woc]#Then he said to the dresser of his vineyard, 'Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree and find none. Cut it down. Why does it encumber the ground?'# 8 [.woc]#And he, answering, said to him, 'Lord, leave it alone this year also until I dig around it and fertilize it.# 9 [.woc]#And if it bears fruit, fine. But if not, then after that you shall cut it down.'#"

10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. 11 And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no way raise herself. 12 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her, "[.woc]#Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.#" 13 And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight and glorified God. 14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, and said to the people, "There are six days in which men ought to work; therefore, come on those days and be healed, and not on the sabbath." 15 The Lord then answered him, and said, "[.woc]#You hypocrite. Does each one of you on the sabbath not untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead him away to watering?# 16 [.woc]#And ought this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound these eighteen years, not be released from this bond on the Sabbath?#" 17 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed. And all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

18 Then he said, "[.woc]#To what is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?# [[luk013-019]]19 [.woc]#It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and cast into his garden, and it grew and became a great tree and the '_birds of the air lodged in its branches._'#"

20 And again he said, "[.woc]#To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?# 21 [.woc]#It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.#"

22 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. 23 Then someone said to him, "Lord, are there few who are saved?" And he said to them, 24 "[.woc]#Strive to enter in at the narrow gate. For I say to you, many will seek to enter in and shall not be able.# 25 [.woc]#When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us,' he will answer and say to you, 'I do not know where you are from.'# 26 [.woc]#Then you will begin to say, 'We have eaten and drank in your presence, and you have taught in our streets.'# [[luk013-027]]27 [.woc]#But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you are from. "_Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity._"'# 28 [.woc]#There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves excluded.# 29 [.woc]#And they will come from the east, from the west, from the north, and from the south and will sit down in the kingdom of God.# 30 [.woc]#And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.#"

31 The same day there came some of the Pharisees, saying to him, "Go out and depart from here, for Herod will kill you." 32 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and I do cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I shall be perfected.# 33 [.woc]#Nevertheless, I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.'# 34 [.woc]#O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to you! How often I would have gathered your children as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!# [[luk013-035]]35 [.woc]#Behold, your house is left to you desolate.

_Christ heals the dropsy on the sabbath, 1-6; teaches humility, 7-11; to make a feast for the poor, 12-14; under the parable of the great supper, shows how worldly minded men who despise the word of God shall be shut out of heaven, 15-24. Those who will be his disciples, bearing their cross, must make their accounts beforehand, lest with shame they revolt from him afterward, 25-33; and become altogether unprofitable, like salt that has lost its savor, 34, 35._

1 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath, that they watched him. 2 And behold, there was a certain man before him who had the dropsy. 3 And Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "[.woc]#Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?#" 4 And they held their peace. And he took him, healed him, and let him go, 5 And answered them, saying, "[.woc]#Which of you having a donkey or an ox fall into a pit would not immediately pull him out on the sabbath?#" 6 And they could not answer him again to these things.

7 And he put forth a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose out the chief places, saying to them, 8 "[.woc]#When you are invited by any man to a wedding, do not sit down in the highest place, lest a more honorable man than you is invited by him,# 9 [.woc]#And he who invited you and him comes and says to you, 'Give this man place,' and you begin with shame to take the lowest place.# 10 [.woc]#But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, 'Friend, go up higher.' Then you shall have honor in the presence of those who sit at the table with you.# 11 [.woc]#For whoever exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.#"

12 Then he also said to him who invited him, "[.woc]#When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, neither your kinsmen, nor your rich neighbors, lest they also invite you again and a recompense be made to you.# 13 [.woc]#But when you make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,# 14 [.woc]#And you shall be blessed, for they cannot recompense you. For you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.#"

15 And when one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, "Blessed is he who eats bread in the kingdom of God."

16 Then he said to him, "[.woc]#A certain man made a great supper, invited many,# 17 [.woc]#And sent his servant at supper-time to say to those who were invited, 'Come, for all things are now ready.'# 18 [.woc]#And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, 'I have bought a piece of ground and I must go and see it. I pray you to have me excused.'# 19 [.woc]#And another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them. I pray you to have me excused.'# 20 [.woc]#And another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore, I cannot come.'# 21 [.woc]#So that servant came and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry, said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.'# 22 [.woc]#And the servant said, 'Lord, it is done as you have commanded, and yet there is room.'# 23 [.woc]#And the lord said to the servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in so that my house may be filled.# 24 [.woc]#For I say to you, that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.'#"

25 And great multitudes went with him. And he turned and said to them, 26 "[.woc]#If any man comes to me and does not hate his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.# 27 [.woc]#And whoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.# 28 [.woc]#For which of you intending to build a tower does not sit down first and count the cost to see if he has enough to finish it?# 29 [.woc]#Or else, after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it, all who behold it begin to mock him,# 30 [.woc]#Saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'# 31 [.woc]#Or what king going to make war against another king does not sit down first and consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?# 32 [.woc]#Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an embassy and desires conditions of peace.# 33 [.woc]#So likewise, whoever he is of you who does not forsake all that he has, he cannot be my disciple.#

34 "[.woc]#Salt is good. But if the salt has lost its savor, with what shall it be seasoned?# 35 [.woc]#It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill, but men cast it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.#"

_The parable of the lost sheep, 1-7; of the piece of silver, 8-10; of the prodigal son, 11-32._

1 Then all the tax collectors and sinners drew near to him to hear him. 2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them."

3 And he spoke this parable to them, saying, 4 "[.woc]#What man of you having one hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he finds it?# 5 [.woc]#And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.# 6 [.woc]#And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.'# 7 [.woc]#I say to you, that likewise, joy shall be in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.#

8 "[.woc]#Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she loses one piece, does not light a candle, sweep the house, and diligently seek until she finds it?# 9 [.woc]#And when she has found it, she calls her friends and her neighbors together, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.'# 10 [.woc]#Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.#"

11 And he said, "[.woc]#A certain man had two sons.# 12 [.woc]#And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.' And he divided his living to them.# 13 [.woc]#And not many days after, the younger son gathered everything together, took his journey into a far country, and wasted his substance there with riotous living.# 14 [.woc]#And when he had spent everything, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in need.# 15 [.woc]#And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.# 16 [.woc]#And he would willingly have filled his belly with the husks that the swine ate, and no man gave to him.# 17 [.woc]#And when he came to himself, he said, 'How many hired servants of my father have bread enough to spare, and I am perishing with hunger!# 18 [.woc]#I will arise and go to my father and say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you# 19 [.woc]#And am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants."'# 20 [.woc]#And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, had compassion, ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him.# 21 [.woc]#And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight and am no longer worthy to be called your son.'# 22 [.woc]#But the father said to his servants, 'Bring forth the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.# 23 [.woc]#And bring the fattened calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry.# 24 [.woc]#For this son of mine was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.' And they began to be merry.#

25 "[.woc]#Now his elder son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.# 26 [.woc]#And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.# 27 [.woc]#And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him in health.'# 28 [.woc]#And he was angry and would not go in. Therefore, his father came out and entreated him.# 29 [.woc]#And he, answering, said to his father, 'Behold, these many years I have served you and I have never transgressed your commandment, and yet you never gave me a kid so that I might make merry with my friends.# 30 [.woc]#But as soon as this son of yours had come, who has devoured your living with harlots, you have killed the fattened calf for him.'# 31 [.woc]#And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me and all that I have is yours.# 32 [.woc]#It was proper that we should make merry and be glad.

1 And he also said to his disciples, "[.woc]#There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was made to him that this man had wasted his goods.# 2 [.woc]#And he called him and said to him, 'How is it that I hear this of you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you may no longer be steward.'# 3 [.woc]#Then the steward said within himself, 'What shall I do? For my lord takes from me the stewardship. I cannot dig. I am ashamed to beg.# 4 [.woc]#I have resolved what to do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.'# 5 [.woc]#So he called each of his lord's debtors, and said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my lord?'# 6 [.woc]#And he said, 'One hundred measures of oil.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.'# 7 [.woc]#Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' And he said, 'One hundred measures of wheat.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill and write eighty.'# 8 [.woc]#And the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.# 9 [.woc]#And I say to you, make for yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.#

10 "[.woc]#He who is faithful in that which is least is also faithful in much, and he who is unjust in the least is also unjust in much.# 11 [.woc]#If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?# 12 [.woc]#And if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who will give you that which is your own?# 13 [.woc]#No servant can serve two masters. For either he will hate one and love the other, or else he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.#"

14 And the Pharisees, who were covetous, also heard all these things, and they derided him. 15 And he said to them, "[.woc]#You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.#

16 "[.woc]#The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presses into it.# 17 [.woc]#And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than one tittle of the law to fail.#

18 "[.woc]#Whoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery, and whoever marries her who is put away from her husband commits adultery.#

19 "[.woc]#There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.# 20 [.woc]#And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus who was laid at his gate, full of sores,# 21 [.woc]#And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores.# 22 [.woc]#And it came to pass, that the beggar died and was carried by angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.# 23 [.woc]#And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Abraham afar off with Lazarus in his bosom.# 24 [.woc]#And he cried, and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.'# 25 [.woc]#But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that in your life-time you received your good things, and Lazarus, in like manner, evil things.

1 Then he said to the disciples, "[.woc]#It is impossible for the causes of sin to not come.

11 And it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. 12 And as he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him there, who stood at a distance. 13 And they lifted up their voices, and said, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us." 14 And when he saw them, he said to them, "[.woc]#Go, show yourselves to the priests.#" And it came to pass, that as they were going, they were cleansed. 15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, 16 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks.

But where are the nine?# 18 [.woc]#There was no one found returning to give glory to God, except this stranger.#" 19 And he said to him, "[.woc]#Arise, depart. Your faith has made you whole.#"

20 And when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, "[.woc]#The kingdom of God does not come with observation,# 21 [.woc]#Neither will they say, 'Behold here!' or, 'Behold there!' For behold, the kingdom of God is within you.#"

22 And he said to his disciples, "[.woc]#The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.# 23 [.woc]#And they will say to you, 'See here,' or, 'See there.'

But afterward, he said within himself, 'Though I do not fear God, nor regard man,# 5 [.woc]#Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.'#" 6 And the Lord said, "[.woc]#Hear what the unjust judge says.# 7 [.woc]#And will God not avenge his own elect, who cry day and night to him, though he bears long with them?# 8 [.woc]#I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, will he find faith on the earth?#"

9 And he spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 10 "[.woc]#Two men went up into the temple to pray: one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.# 11 [.woc]#The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: 'God, I thank you that I am not as other men are: extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.# 12 [.woc]#I fast twice in the week. I give tithes of all that I possess.'# 13 [.woc]#And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his chest, saying, 'God be merciful to me a sinner.'# 14 [.woc]#I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.#"

15 And they also brought infants to him so that he might touch them. But when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 16 But Jesus called them to him, and said, "[.woc]#Allow little children to come to me and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.# 17 [.woc]#Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no way enter into it.#"

18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, "Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" 19 And Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one: God.# [[luk018-020]]20 [.woc]#You know the commandments: '_Do not commit adultery,_' '_Do not kill,_' '_Do not steal,_' '_Do not bear false witness,_' '_Honor your father and your mother._'#" 21 And he said, "All these I have kept from my youth." 22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, "[.woc]#Yet you lack one thing: sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.#" 23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful, for he was very rich. 24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, "[.woc]#How hardly those who have riches will enter into the kingdom of God!# 25 [.woc]#For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.#" 26 And those who heard it, said, "Who then can be saved?" 27 Then he said, "[.woc]#The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.#"

28 Then Peter said, "Behold, we have left all and followed you." 29 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Truly I say to you, there is no man who has left house, parents, brothers, wife, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God# 30 [.woc]#Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and life everlasting in the age to come.#"

31 Then he took the twelve, and said to them, "[.woc]#Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.# 32 [.woc]#For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, mocked, spitefully treated, and spit upon.# 33 [.woc]#And they will scourge him and put him to death, and on the third day he will rise again.#" 34 But they understood none of these things, and this saying was hid from them, neither did they know the things which were spoken.

35 And it came to pass, that as he had come near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging. 36 And hearing the multitude passing by, he asked what it meant. 37 And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. 38 And he cried, saying, "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me." 39 And those who went before rebuked him so that he would hold his peace. But he cried so much the more: "Son of David, have mercy on me." 40 And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he had come near, he asked him, 41 Saying, "[.woc]#What do you wish that I shall do to you?#" And he said, "Lord, that I may receive my sight." 42 And Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Receive your sight. Your faith has saved you.#" 43 And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And when they saw it, all the people gave praise to God.

=== Chapter 19

[.outline.text-center]
_Of Zaccheus a tax collector, 1-10. The ten pieces of money, 11-27. Christ rides into Jerusalem with triumph, 28-40; weeps over it, 41-44; drives the buyers and sellers out of the temple, 45, 46; teaching daily in it. The rulers seek to destroy him, but fear the people, 47, 48._

1 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. 2 And behold, there was a man named Zaccheus, who was the chief among the tax collectors, and he was rich. 3 And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was little of stature. 4 And he ran ahead and climbed up upon a sycamore-tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, "[.woc]#Zaccheus, make haste and come down, for today I must abide at your house.#" 6 And he made haste, came down, and received him joyfully. 7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying that he had gone to be guest with a man who is a sinner. 8 And Zaccheus stood, and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him four-fold." 9 And Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#This day salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.# 10 [.woc]#For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.#"

11 And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear. 12 He said therefore, "[.woc]#A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.# 13 [.woc]#And he called his ten servants and delivered to them ten minas, and said to them, 'Occupy until I come.'# 14 [.woc]#But his citizens hated him and sent a message after him, saying, 'We will not have this man to reign over us.'# 15 [.woc]#And it came to pass, that when he had returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, so that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.# 16 [.woc]#Then the first came, saying, 'Lord, your mina has gained ten minas.'# 17 [.woc]#And he said to him, 'Well done, good servant. Because you have been faithful in a very little, you have authority over ten cities.'# 18 [.woc]#And the second came, saying, 'Lord, your mina has gained five minas.'# 19 [.woc]#And he said likewise to him, 'You are to be over five cities.'# 20 [.woc]#And another came, saying, 'Lord, behold, here is your mina, which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief,# 21 [.woc]#For I feared you because you are an austere man. You take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.'# 22 [.woc]#And he says to him, 'Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew me to be an austere man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow.# 23 [.woc]#Why then did you not put my money into the bank? And I, having come, might have collected it with interest.'# 24 [.woc]#And he said to those who stood by, 'Take from him the mina and give it to him who has ten minas.'# 25 [.woc]#And they said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas.'# 26 [.woc]#'For I say to you, that to everyone who has shall be given, and from him who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.# 27 [.woc]#But these enemies of mine who did not wish that I should reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.'#"

28 And when he had thus spoken, he went ahead, ascending toward Jerusalem.

29 And it came to pass, when he had come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, 30 Saying, "[.woc]#Go into the village over against you, in which at your entering you will find a colt tied on which no man has ever sat. Untie him and bring him here.# 31 [.woc]#And if any man asks you, 'Why do you untie him?' you shall say thus to him: 'Because the Lord has need of him.'#" 32 And those who were sent, went and found even as he had said to them. 33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why do you untie the colt?" 34 And they said, "The Lord has need of him." 35 Then they brought him to Jesus, cast their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus upon him. 36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. 37 And when he had come near, even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, [[luk019-038]]38 Saying,

39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, "Master, rebuke your disciples." 40 And he answered and said to them, "[.woc]#I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.#"

41 And when he had come near, he beheld the city and wept over it, 42 Saying, "[.woc]#If you, even you, had only known in this day the things which belong to your peace! But now they are hid from your eyes.# 43 [.woc]#For the days shall come upon you, that your enemies shall build a barricade around you, encompass you, keep you in on every side,# 44 [.woc]#And shall level you and your children within you to the ground. And they shall not leave in you one stone upon another because you did not know the time of your visitation.#"

45 And he went into the temple and began to cast out those who sold in it and those who bought, [[luk019-046]]46 Saying to them, "[.woc]#It is written, '_My house is the house of prayer,_' but you have made it '_a den of thieves._'#"

47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests, the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, 48 And could not find what they might do, for all the people were very attentive to hear him.

=== Chapter 20

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ avouches his authority by a question of John's baptism, 1-8. The parable of the vineyard, 9-18. Of giving tribute to Caesar, 19-26. He convinces the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, 27-40. How Christ is the Son of David, 41-44. He warns his disciples to beware of the scribes, 45-47._

1 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him, with the elders, 2 And spoke to him, saying, "Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? Or who is he who gave you this authority?" 3 And he answered and said to them, "[.woc]#I will also ask you one thing. Answer me.# 4 [.woc]#The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?#" 5 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' 6 But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet." 7 And they answered that they could not tell where it was from. 8 And Jesus said to them, "[.woc]#Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.#"

9 Then he began to speak to the people this parable: "[.woc]#A certain man planted a vineyard, leased it to farmers, and went into a far country for a long time.# 10 [.woc]#And at the season he sent a servant to the farmers so that they should give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty.# 11 [.woc]#And again he sent another servant, and they beat him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.# 12 [.woc]#And again he sent the third, and they wounded him also and cast him out.# 13 [.woc]#Then the lord of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be when they see him they will reverence him.'# 14 [.woc]#But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.'# 15 [.woc]#So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?# 16 [.woc]#He will come and destroy these farmers and will give the vineyard to others.#" And when they heard it, they said, "May that never be." [[luk020-017]]17 And he beheld them, and said, "[.woc]#What is this then that is written:#

[.woc]#_the same has become the head of the corner_'?#
|===

18 [.woc]#Whoever falls upon that stone shall be broken, but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.#"

19 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him, and they feared the people, for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them. 20 And they watched him and sent forth spies who should feign themselves to be just men so that they might take hold of his words, and that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor. 21 And they asked him, saying, "Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither do you accept the person of any, but teach the way of God truly. 22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?" 23 But he perceived their craftiness and said to them, "[.woc]#Why do you test me?# 24 [.woc]#Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription does it have?#" They answered and said, "Caesar's." 25 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Render therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.#" 26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people. And they marveled at his answer and held their peace.

27 Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, came to him and they asked him, [[luk020-028]]28 Saying, "Master, Moses wrote to us that '_if any man's brother should die, having a wife, and he should die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up children for his brother._' 29 There were therefore seven brothers: the first took a wife and died without children, 30 the second took her for a wife and he died childless, 31 Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven all died and they left no children. 32 Last of all the woman also died. 33 Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be? For seven had her for a wife."

34 And Jesus, answering, said to them, "[.woc]#The children of this world marry and are given in marriage,# 35 [.woc]#But those who are accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,# 36 [.woc]#Neither can they die anymore, because they are equal to the angels and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.# [[luk020-037]]37 [.woc]#But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed it at the bush when he calls the Lord '_the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob._'# 38 [.woc]#For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.#" 39 Then some of the scribes, answering, said, "Master, you have well said." 40 And after that, they dared not ask him any question at all.

41 And he said to them, "[.woc]#How do they say that Christ is David's son?# [[luk020-042]]42 [.woc]#And David himself says in the book of Psalms,#

44 [.woc]#David therefore calls him Lord. How is he then his son?#"

45 Then in the audience of all the people, he said to his disciples, 46 "[.woc]#Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes, love greetings in the markets, the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts,# 47 [.woc]#Who devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers.

_Christ commends the poor widow, 1-4. He foretells the destruction of the temple and of the city of Jerusalem, 5-24; the signs also which shall be before the last day, 25-33. He exhorts them to be watchful, 34-38._

1 And he looked up and saw rich men casting their gifts into the treasury. 2 And he also saw a certain poor widow casting in there two mites. 3 And he said, "[.woc]#Of a truth I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all of them.# 4 [.woc]#For all these cast in the offerings of God out of their abundance, but she out of her penury has cast in all the living that she had.#"

5 And as some spoke of the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, he said, 6 "[.woc]#As for these things which you behold, the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.#"

7 And they asked him, saying, "Master, but when will these things be? And what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?" 8 And he said, "[.woc]#Take heed that you do not be deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am Christ,' and, 'The time draws near.' Therefore, do not go after them.# 9 [.woc]#But when you hear of wars and commotions, do not be terrified.

25 "[.woc]#And there shall be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars, and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves.# 26 [.woc]#Men's hearts will fail them for fear and for apprehension of those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.# [[luk021-027]]27 [.woc]#And then they shall see '_the Son of man coming in a cloud_' with power and great glory.# 28 [.woc]#And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draws near.#"

29 And he spoke to them a parable: "[.woc]#Behold the fig-tree and all the trees.# 30 [.woc]#As soon as they shoot forth, you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near at hand.# 31 [.woc]#So likewise, when you see these things come to pass, you know that the kingdom of God is near at hand.# 32 [.woc]#Truly I say to you, this generation shall not pass away until all is fulfilled.# 33 [.woc]#Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away.#

37 In the day-time he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out and stayed on the mountain that is called the Mount of Olives. 38 And all the people came to him early in the morning to hear him in the temple.

[.outline.text-center]
_The Jews conspire against Christ, 1, 2. Satan prepares Judas to betray him, 3-6. The apostles prepare the passover, 7-18. Christ institutes his holy supper, 19, 20; covertly foretells of the traitor, 21-23; dissuades the rest of his apostles from ambition, 24-30; assures Peter his faith should not fail, 31-33; and yet he should deny him three times, 34-38. He prays on the mount and sweats blood, 32-46; is betrayed with a kiss, 47-49; he heals Malchus' ear, 50-53; he is three times denied by Peter, 54-62; shamefully abused, 63-65; and confesses himself to be the Son of God, 66-71._

1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover. 2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him, for they feared the people.

3 Then Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. 4 And he went and discussed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him to them. 5 And they were glad and covenanted to give him money. 6 And he promised and sought opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.

7 Then the day of unleavened bread came when the passover must be killed. 8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, "[.woc]#Go and prepare for us the passover so that we may eat.#" 9 And they said to him, "Where do you wish that we prepare?" 10 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man bearing a pitcher of water shall meet you there. Follow him into the house where he enters.# 11 [.woc]#And you shall say to the master of the house, 'The Master says to you, "Where is the guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?"'# 12 [.woc]#And he will show you a large upper room furnished. Make ready there.#" 13 And they went and found it as he had said to them, and they made ready the passover.

14 And when the hour had come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. 15 And he said to them, "[.woc]#I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.# 16 [.woc]#For I say to you, I will no longer eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.#" 17 And he took the cup, gave thanks, and said, "[.woc]#Take this and divide it among yourselves.# 18 [.woc]#For I say to you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.#" 19 And he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "[.woc]#This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.#" 20 Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, "[.woc]#This cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you.# 21 [.woc]#But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.# 22 [.woc]#And truly the Son of man goes as it was determined. But woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!#" 23 And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was who should do this thing.

24 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. 25 And he said to them, "[.woc]#The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.# 26 [.woc]#But you shall not be this way. But he who is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he who is chief, as he who serves.# 27 [.woc]#For which is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? But I am among you as he who serves.#

28 "[.woc]#You are those who have continued with me in my temptations.# 29 [.woc]#And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed to me,# 30 [.woc]#So that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.#"

31 And the Lord said, "[.woc]#Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you so that he may sift you as wheat.# 32 [.woc]#But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. When you are converted, strengthen your brothers.#" 33 And he said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both into prison and to death." 34 And he said, "[.woc]#I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day before you deny three times that you know me.#"

35 And he said to them, "[.woc]#When I sent you without purse, sack, and shoes, did you lack anything?#" And they said, "Nothing." 36 Then he said to them, "[.woc]#But now he who has a purse, let him take it, and likewise his sack. And he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.# [[luk022-037]]37 [.woc]#For I say to you, that this which is written must still be accomplished in me: '_And he was reckoned among the transgressors._' For the things concerning me have an end.#" 38 And they said, "Lord, behold, here are two swords." And he said to them, "[.woc]#It is enough.#"

39 And he came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him. 40 And when he was at the place, he said to them, "[.woc]#Pray so that you do not enter into temptation.#" 41 And he withdrew from them about a stone's cast, knelt down, and prayed, 42 Saying, "[.woc]#Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done.#" 43 And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. 44 And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly. And his sweat was like great drops of blood falling to the ground. 45 And when he arose from prayer and had come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, 46 And said to them, "[.woc]#Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.#"

47 And while he was still speaking, behold a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss him. 48 But Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?#" 49 When those who were around him saw what would follow, they said to him, "Lord, shall we smite with the sword?" 50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 51 And Jesus answered and said, "[.woc]#Allow me to do this.#" And he touched his ear and healed him. 52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, "[.woc]#Have you come out as against a thief with swords and staffs?# 53 [.woc]#When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched forth no hands against me. But this is your hour and the power of darkness.#"

54 Then they took him, led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed at a distance. 55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and had sat down together, Peter sat down among them. 56 But a certain woman-servant beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him, and said, "This man was also with him." 57 And he denied him, saying, "Woman, I do not know him." 58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, "You are also one of them." And Peter said, "Man, I am not." 59 And about an hour later, another confidently affirmed, saying, "In truth this man was also with him, for he is a Galilean." 60 And Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you say." And immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. 61 And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times." 62 And Peter went out and wept bitterly.

63 And the men who held Jesus mocked him and smote him. 64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, saying, "Prophesy. Who is he who smote you?" 65 And many other things they blasphemously spoke against him.

66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, the chief priests, and the scribes came together and led him into their council, 67 Saying, "Are you the Christ? Tell us." And he said to them, "[.woc]#If I tell you, you will not believe.# 68 [.woc]#And if I also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.# 69 [.woc]#Hereafter, the Son of man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.#" 70 Then they all said, "Are you then the Son of God?" And he said to them, "[.woc]#You say that I am.#" 71 And they said, "What need do we have of any further testimony? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth."

=== Chapter 23

[.outline.text-center]
_Jesus is accused before Pilate and sent to Herod, 1-7. Herod mocks him, 8-11. Herod and Pilate are made friends, 12. Barabbas is desired by the people and is released by Pilate, and Jesus is given to be crucified, 13-25. He tells the women who lament him of the destruction of Jerusalem, 26-33; prays for his enemies, 34-38. Two evildoers are crucified with him, 39-45. His death, 46-49. His burial, 50-56._

1 And the whole multitude of them arose and led him to Pilate. 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying, that he himself is Christ a king." 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him and said, "[.woc]#You say it.#" 4 Then Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people, "I find no fault in this man." 5 And they were the more fierce, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place."

6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. 7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time.

8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad. For he had been for a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. 9 Then he questioned with him in many words, but he answered him nothing. 10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. 11 And Herod with his troops set him at nothing, mocked him, arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him back to Pilate. 12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together, for before they were at enmity between themselves.

13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, 14 Said to them, "You have brought this man to me as one who perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I have found no fault in this man, touching those things of which you accuse him, 15 Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him. 16 I will therefore chastise him and release him." 17 (For of necessity he must release someone to them at the feast.)

18 And they cried out all at once, saying, "Away with this man. Release Barabbas to us." 19 (He was cast into prison for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder.) 20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them. 21 But they cried, saying, "Crucify, crucify him." 22 And he said to them the third time, "Why? What evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him. I will therefore chastise him and let him go." 23 And they were urgent with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed. 24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 25 And he released to them him who had been cast into prison for sedition and murder, whom they had desired, but he delivered Jesus to their will.

26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one, Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross so that he might bear it after Jesus.

27 And there followed him a great company of people, including women who also bewailed and lamented him. 28 But Jesus, turning to them, said, "[.woc]#Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.# 29 [.woc]#For behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never nourished infants.'# [[luk023-030]]30 [.woc]#Then '_they shall begin to say to the mountains, "Fall on us," and to the hills, "Cover us."_'# 31 [.woc]#For if they do these things in a green tree, what will be done in the dry?#"

32 And two others, who were malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.

33 And when they had come to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified him and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left. 34 Then Jesus said, "[.woc]#Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.#" And they parted his clothing and cast lots. 35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself if he is Christ the chosen of God." 36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, 37 And saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself." 38 And also a superscription was written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."

39 And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed on him, saying, "If you are Christ, save yourself and us." 40 But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation? 41 And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds. But this man has done nothing amiss." 42 And he said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom." 43 And Jesus said to him, "[.woc]#Truly I say to you, this day you shall be with me in paradise.#"

44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. 45 And the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. [[luk023-046]]46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "[.woc]#Father, '_into your hands I commend my spirit._'#" And having said this, he expired. 47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man." 48 And all the people who came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their chests and returned. 49 And all his acquaintances and the women who followed him from Galilee stood afar off beholding these things.

50 And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor, a good and just man 51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them) from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. 52 This man went to Pilate and petitioned for the body of Jesus. 53 And he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone, in which no man was ever laid before. 54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. 55 And the women who came with him from Galilee followed and beheld the sepulcher and how his body was laid. 56 And they returned and prepared spices and ointments. And they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.

=== Chapter 24

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ's resurrection is declared by two angels to the women who come to the sepulcher, 1-8. These report it to others, 9-12. Christ himself appears to the two disciples who went to Emmaus, 13-35. Afterward, he appears to the apostles and reproves their unbelief, 36-46; gives them a charge, 47, 48; promises the Holy Spirit, 49; and so ascends into heaven, 50-53._

1 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulcher bringing the spices which they had prepared, and there were others with them. 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher. 3 And they entered in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed at this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments. 5 And as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead? 6 He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee, 7 Saying, 'The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.'" 8 Then they remembered his words, 9 And returned from the sepulcher and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. 10 It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and other women who were with them who told these things to the apostles. 11 Their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they did not believe them. 12 Then Peter arose and ran to the sepulcher, and stooping down, he beheld the linen cloths laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass.

13 And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about sixty furlongs. 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 15 And it came to pass, that while they talked together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. 16 But their eyes were held so that they should not know him. 17 And he said to them, "[.woc]#What manner of communications are these that you have with one another as you walk, and are sad?#" 18 And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said to him, "Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem and have not known the things which have come to pass there in these days?" 19 And he said to them, "[.woc]#What things?#" And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him. 21 But we trusted that it had been he who would have redeemed Israel. And besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done. 22 And even some women of our company made us astonished. They arrived early at the sepulcher, 23 And when they did not find his body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. 24 And some of them who were with us went to the sepulcher and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him." 25 Then he said to them, "[.woc]#O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!# 26 [.woc]#Did Christ not have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?#" 27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.

28 And they drew near to the village where they were going, and he acted as though he would go further. 29 But they constrained him, saying, "Abide with us, for it is toward evening and the day is far spent." And he went in to stay with them. 30 And it came to pass, as he sat at the table with them, he took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them. 31 And their eyes were opened and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight. 32 And they said to one another, "Did our hearts not burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened the Scriptures to us?" 33 And they rose the same hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven assembled and those who were with them, 34 Saying, "The Lord has risen indeed and has appeared to Simon." 35 And they told the things that were done in the way and how he was made known to them in breaking of bread.

36 And as they were thus speaking, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and says to them, "[.woc]#Peace be to you.#" 37 But they were terrified and frightened and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 38 And he said to them, "[.woc]#Why are you troubled? And why do thoughts arise in your hearts?# 39 [.woc]#Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.#" 40 And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41 And while they still did not believe for joy and wondered, he said to them, "[.woc]#Do you have anything here for food?#" 42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and a honey-comb. 43 And he took it and ate it before them.

44 And he said to them, "[.woc]#These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written concerning me in the law of Moses, in the prophets, and in the psalms.#" 45 Then he opened their understanding so that they might understand the Scriptures, 46 And said to them, "[.woc]#Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day,# [[luk024-047]]47 [.woc]#And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.# 48 [.woc]#And you are witnesses of these things.# 49 [.woc]#And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.#"

50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them. 51 And it came to pass, while he was blessing them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. 52 And they, having worshiped him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
