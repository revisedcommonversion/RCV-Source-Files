=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ, preparing his apostles for the beholding of his ascension, gathers them together on mount Olivet, commands them to expect in Jerusalem the sending down of the Holy Spirit, promises after a few days to send him, and ascends into heaven in their sight, 1-9. After his ascension they are warned by two angels to depart and to set their minds upon his second coming, 10, 11. They accordingly return, and, giving themselves to prayer, choose Matthias to be apostle in place of Judas, 12-26._

1 The former treatise I have made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach 2 Until the day in which he was taken up after he had given commandments through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen, 3 To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen by them forty days and speaking about the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, 4 And being assembled with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, he says, "[.woc]#You have heard from me.# 5 [.woc]#For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.#"

6 When they therefore had come together, they asked him, saying, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" 7 And he said to them, "[.woc]#It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father has put in his own power.# 8 [.woc]#But you shall receive power after the Holy Spirit has come upon you. And you shall be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea, in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.#"

9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. 10 And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, 11 Who also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up to heaven? This same Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven shall come in the same manner as you have seen him go into heaven."

12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. 13 And when they had arrived, they went into the upper room where they were staying, namely, Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. 14 All of these continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.

15 And in those days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said (the number of the names together were about one hundred and twenty), 16 "Men, brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who was a guide to those who took Jesus. 17 For he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry." 18 (Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling headlong, he burst apart in the midst and all his bowels gushed out. 19 And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem, so that in their proper language that field is called, Aceldama, that is to say, The Field of Blood.)

21 "Therefore, from these men who accompanied us the whole time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us— 22 Beginning from the baptism of John to that same day that he was taken up from us—one of these must be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection." 23 And they appointed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 24 And they prayed, and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which of these two you have chosen 25 So that he may take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell in order to go to his own place." 26 And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_The apostles, filled with the Holy Spirit and speaking various languages, are admired by some and derided by others, 1-13; whom Peter disproves, 14-36; he baptizes a great number who were converted, 37-40; who afterward devoutly and charitably fellowship together; the apostles working many miracles, and God daily increasing his church, 41-47._

1 And when the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. 3 And there appeared to them tongues like fire that separated and sat upon each of them. 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit gave them utterance.

5 And there were Jews dwelling at Jerusalem, devout men, from every nation under heaven. 6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together and were confounded because every man heard them speak in his own language. 7 And they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, "Behold, are all these who speak not Galileans? 8 And how do we hear every man in our own language to which we were born? 9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea, Cappadocia, in Pontus, Asia, 10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, in Egypt, in the parts of Libya around Cyrene, strangers of Rome, both Jews and Proselytes, 11 Cretes and Arabians—we hear them speak in our languages the wonderful works of God." 12 And they were all amazed and in doubt, saying to one another, "What does this mean?" 13 Others mocking, said, "These men are full of new wine."

14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them, "Men of Judea and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, may this be known to you, and listen to my words. 15 For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. 16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel:

29 "Men, brothers, let me freely speak to you concerning the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried and his sepulcher is with us to this day. 30 Therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath that from the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne, 31 He, seeing this before, spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption. 32 God has raised up this Jesus, of which we all are witnesses. 33 Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you now see and hear.

36 "Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made that same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ."

37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men, brothers, what shall we do?" [[act002-038]]38 Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is to you, to your children, and to all who are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." 40 And with many other words he testified and exhorted, saying, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation." 41 Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. And the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls. [[act002-042]]42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in breaking of bread, and in prayers.

43 And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and had all things common, 45 And sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men, as every man had need. 46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, ate their food with gladness and singleness of heart, 47 Praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added daily to the church those who were being saved.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Peter, preaching to the people who came to see a lame man restored to his feet, 1-11, professes the cure not to have been wrought by his or John's own power or holiness, but by God and his son Jesus, and through faith in his name, 12. In addition, he reproves them for crucifying Jesus, 13-16; which they did through ignorance, and thereby fulfilled God's determinate counsel and the Scriptures, 17, 18. He exhorts them by repentance and faith to seek remission of their sins and salvation in the same Jesus, 19-26._

1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. 2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask for alms from those who entered into the temple. 3 Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms. 4 And Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, "Look at us." 5 And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them. 6 Then Peter said, "I do not have silver and gold, but what I have, I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk." 7 And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up. And immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. 8 And leaping up, he stood, walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God. 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God, 10 And they knew that it was he who sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.

11 And as the lame man who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. 12 And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why do you look so earnestly at us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? 13 The God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. 14 But you denied the Holy and Just One and desired a murderer to be granted to you, 15 And killed the Prince of life whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. 16 And through faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Indeed, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.

17 "And now, brothers, I know that through ignorance you did it, as your rulers also did. 18 But those things which God before had shown by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has thus fulfilled. 19 Therefore, repent and be converted so that your sins may be blotted out, and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, 20 And that he may send Jesus Christ, who before was preached to you, 21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. [[act003-022]]22 For Moses truly said to the fathers, '_The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brothers. You shall hear him in all things, whatever he says to you._ [[act003-023]]23 _And it shall come to pass, that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people._' 24 And also all the prophets from Samuel, and those who follow, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold these days. [[act003-025]]25 You are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, '_And in your offspring all the kindreds of the earth shall be blessed._' 26 God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to you first to bless you in turning away each of you from his iniquities."

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_The rulers of the Jews, offended by Peter's sermon, 1, 2, imprison him and John, 3, 4. After examining Peter for boldly avouching the lame man to be healed by the name of Jesus, and that by the same Jesus only we must be eternally saved, 5-12, they command him and John to preach no more in that name, adding also threatening, 13-22; whereupon the church flees to prayer, 23-30. And God, by moving the place where they were assembled, testifies that he heard their prayer; confirming the church with the gift of the Holy Spirit and with mutual love and charity, 31-37._

1 And as they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came upon them, 2 Being grieved that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 3 And they laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening. 4 But many of them who heard the word believed. And the number of the men was about five thousand.

5 And it came to pass on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes, 6 And Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were assembled at Jerusalem. 7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, "By what power, or by what name have you done this?" 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders of Israel, 9 If we this day are examined concerning the good deed done to the sick man, by what means he is made sound, 10 May it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him this man stands here before you sound. [[act004-011]]11 This is '_the stone which was set at nothing by you builders, which has become the head of the corner._' 12 There is not salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."

13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. 14 And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. 15 But when they had commanded them to withdraw from the council, they conferred among themselves, 16 Saying, "What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is manifest to all those who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. 17 But so that it may spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them that they speak from now on to no man in this name." 18 And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus. 19 But Peter and John answered and said to them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves. 20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard." 21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people, for all men glorified God for that which was done. 22 For the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was performed.

23 And being dismissed, they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. [[act004-024]]24 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, "'_Lord, you are God, who made heaven, earth, the sea, and all that is in them,_' [[act004-025]]25 Who, by the mouth of your servant David, said,

27 "For in truth, against your holy child Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were assembled, 28 To do whatever your hand and your counsel determined before to be done. 29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings and grant to your servants that with all boldness they may speak your word, 30 By stretching forth your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of your holy child Jesus." 31 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and they spoke the word of God with boldness.

32 And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and of one soul, neither did any of them say that anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common. 33 And with great power the apostles gave testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. 34 Neither was there anyone among them who was in need, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the money from the things that were sold 35 And laid it down at the apostles' feet. And distribution was made to every man according as he had need.

36 And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, The Son of Consolation), a Levite and from the country of Cyprus, 37 Having land, sold it, brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_Ananias and Sapphira his wife fell down dead for their hypocrisy at Peter's rebuke, 1-11. The rest of the apostles wrought many miracles, 12, 13; to the increase of the faith, 14-16. The apostles are again imprisoned, 17, 18; but delivered by an angel bidding them preach openly to all, 19, 20. But after their teaching accordingly in the temple, 21-28, and before the council, 29-32, they are in danger to be killed; but through the advice of Gamaliel, a great counselor among the Jews, they are kept alive and are only beaten, for which they glorify God, 33-41. They did not cease from daily preaching, 42._

1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, 2 Kept back part of the price (his wife also being aware of it), and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet. 3 But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the value of the land? 4 While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own power? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God." 5 And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired. And great fear came on all those who heard these things. 6 And the young men arose, wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.

7 And it was about three hours later when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. 8 And Peter answered to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?" And she said, "Yes, for so much." 9 Then Peter said to her, "How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door and shall carry you out." 10 Then she fell down immediately at his feet and expired. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. 11 And great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things.

12 And by the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were wrought among the people, and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. 13 And of the rest, no man dared join himself to them, but the people magnified them. 14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women. 15 They even brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches so that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. 16 There also came a multitude out of the cities around to Jerusalem bringing sick persons and those who were afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.

17 Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with indignation, 18 Laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. 19 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison-doors and brought them forth, and said, 20 "Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life." 21 And when they heard this, they entered into the temple at dawn and taught. But the high priest and those who were with him came and called the council together—all the senate of the children of Israel—and sent to the prison to have them brought. 22 But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported, 23 Saying, "We truly found the prison shut with all safety and the keepers standing outside before the doors. But when we had opened, we found no man inside." 24 Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they were doubting concerning them and to what this would come. 25 Then someone came and told them, saying, "Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people." 26 Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.

27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council, and the high priest asked them, 28 Saying, "Did we not strictly command you that you should not teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us." 29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, "We ought to obey God rather than men. 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree. 31 God has exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 32 And we are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."

33 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them. 34 Then someone in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, had in reputation among all the people, stood up and commanded to put the apostles forth a little time. 35 And said to them, "Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do concerning these men. 36 For before these days, Theudas rose, boasting himself to be somebody, to whom a number of about four hundred men joined themselves. He was slain, and as many as obeyed him were all scattered and brought to nothing. 37 After this man, Judas of Galilee rose in the days of the taxing and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and even as many as obeyed him were all dispersed. 38 And now I say to you, refrain from these men and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this work is from men, it will come to nothing, 39 But if it is from God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God."

40 And they assented to him. And when they had called the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and let them go. 41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. 42 And daily in the temple and in every house they did not cease to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

[.outline.text-center]
_The Hellenistic Jews are discontent that their widows were neglected in the daily ministration, and to address this, the apostles meet, 1, 2, recommend, 3, 4, and with the church's consent, ordain seven chosen men to the office of deaconship, 5, 6. The word of God prevails, 7. Stephen, full of faith and the Holy Spirit, disproving those with whom he disputed, is brought before the council and falsely accused of blasphemy against the law and the temple, 8-15._

1 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. 2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples, and said, "It is not fitting that we should leave the word of God and serve tables. 3 Therefore, brothers, select among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. 4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word." 5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and also Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch. 6 They set these men before the apostles, and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.

7 And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.

8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and miracles among the people. 9 Then there arose some from the synagogue called the Libertines, along with Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and some of those from Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen. 10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke. 11 Then they suborned men, who said, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God." 12 And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, caught him, brought him to the council, 13 And set up false witnesses, who said, "This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law. 14 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us." 15 And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

[.outline.text-center]
_Stephen, permitted to answer to the accusation of blasphemy, 1, shows that Abraham worshiped God rightly, and how God chose the fathers, 2-19, before Moses was born and before the tabernacle and temple were built, 20-36; that Moses himself witnessed of Christ, 37-43; and that all outward ceremonies were ordained, according to the heavenly pattern, to last only for a time, 44-50; reproving their rebellion and murdering of Christ, the Just One, whom the prophets foretold should come into the world, 51-53. Upon hearing that, they stone him to death, while he commends his soul to Jesus and humbly prays for them, 54-60._

1 Then the high priest said, "Are these things so?"

2 And he said, "Men, brothers, and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, [[act007-003]]3 And said to him, '_Depart from your country and from your kindred and come into the land which I shall show you._' 4 Then he came from the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, when his father was dead, he moved him into this land in which you now dwell. [[act007-005]]5 And he gave him no inheritance in it, not even so much as to set his foot on. Yet he promised that '_he would give it to him for a possession, and to his offspring after him,_' when he still had no child. [[act007-006]]6 And God spoke in this way, that '_his offspring should sojourn in a foreign land, and that they should bring them into bondage and treat them ill four hundred years._' [[act007-007]]7 '_And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage I will judge,_' said God. 'And after that they shall come forth "_and serve me in this place._"' 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. Then Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot the twelve patriarchs.

9 "And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him 10 And delivered him from all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, who made him governor over Egypt and all his house.

11 "Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers found no sustenance. 12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. 13 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's kindred was made known to Pharaoh. 14 Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his kindred to him, seventy-five souls. 15 So Jacob went down into Egypt and died—he and our fathers. 16 They were carried over into Shechem and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem.

17 "But when the time of the promise drew near which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, [[act007-018]]18 Until '_another king arose who did not know Joseph._' 19 The same dealt subtly with our kindred and ill-treated our fathers, making them cast out their young children so that they would not live. 20 At that time, Moses was born and was exceedingly fair and nourished in his father's house for three months. 21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him as her own son. 22 And Moses was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds. 23 And when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers the children of Israel. 24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him and avenged him who was oppressed and smote the Egyptian. 25 For he supposed his brothers to understand that God by his hand would deliver them, but they did not understand. 26 And the next day he showed himself to them as they were contending and would have constrained them to be at peace again, saying, 'Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you do wrong to one another?' [[act007-027]]27 But he who did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, '_Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?_ [[act007-028]]28 _Will you kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?_' [[act007-029]]29 Then '_Moses fled at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Midian,_' where he begot two sons.

[[act007-030]]30 "And when forty years had expired, there '_appeared to him_' in the wilderness of mount Sinai, '_an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush._' 31 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. And as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came to him, [[act007-032]]32 Saying, '_I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob._' Then Moses trembled and dared not behold. [[act007-033]]33 Then the Lord said to him, '_Take off your shoes from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground._ [[act007-034]]34 _I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and I have heard their groaning. And I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you into Egypt._'

[[act007-035]]35 "This Moses, whom they refused, saying, '_Who made you a ruler and a judge?_' the same, God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. 36 He brought them out after he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years. [[act007-037]]37 This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel, '_The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You will hear him._' 38 This is he who was in the church in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on the mount Sinai and with our fathers, who received the living oracles to give to us, 39 Whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, [[act007-040]]40 Saying to Aaron, '_Make us gods to go before us. For as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him._' 41 And they made a calf in those days, offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. [[act007-042]]42 Then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets,

44 "Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen, 45 Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered into the possession of the nations, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David, 46 Who found favor before God and asked to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. 47 But Solomon built him a house. 48 Yet, the Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as says the prophet,

54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart and they gnashed at him with their teeth. 55 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, 56 And said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God." 57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, ran upon him with one accord, 58 Cast him out of the city, and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul. 59 And they stoned Stephen as he was calling upon God, and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." 60 And he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, "Lord, do not lay this sin to their charge." And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

=== Chapter 8

[.outline.text-center]
_The disciples were dispersed because of a great persecution at Jerusalem, Saul's persecution of the church, and a church is planted by Philip in Samaria, 1-8. Simon the sorcerer is baptized, along with many others, 9-13. Peter and John are sent there, who prayed for them and laid their hands on them, after which they received the Holy Spirit, 14-17. Simon offers money for the same power, is sharply reproved by Peter for his wickedness and hypocrisy, and admonished to repent, 18-24. The apostles return to Jerusalem, having preached the word, 25. Philip is sent by an angel to convert and baptize an Ethiopian eunuch 26-40._

1 And Saul was consenting to his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem, and they were all dispersed throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. 2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him. 3 As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house and hauling off men and women and committing them to prison.

4 Therefore, those who were dispersed went everywhere preaching the word. 5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them. 6 And the people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he performed. 7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many who were possessed, and many who were paralyzed and who were lame were healed. 8 And there was great joy in that city.

9 But there was a certain man called Simon, who previously in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was some great one, 10 To whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the great power of God." 11 And to him they had regard, because for a long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. 12 But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 13 Then Simon himself believed also. And when he was baptized, he continued with Philip and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.

14 Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, 15 Who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit. 16 (For as yet he had fallen upon none of them. Only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 17 Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. 18 And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, 19 Saying, "Give me this power also so that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit." 20 But Peter said to him, "May your money perish with you because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. 21 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God. 22 Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven. 23 For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity." 24 Then Simon answered, and said, "Pray to the Lord for me that none of these things which you have spoken come upon me."

25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.

26 And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Arise, and go toward the south, to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert." 27 And he arose and went, and behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship 28 And was returning and sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet. 29 Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go near and join yourself to this chariot." 30 And Philip ran there to him and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, "Do you understand what you read?" 31 And he said, "How can I unless someone guides me?" And he entreated Philip to come up and sit with him. [[act008-032]]32 The place of the Scripture which he read was this:

34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, "I pray you, of whom does the prophet speak this? Of himself, or of some other man?" 35 Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same Scripture and preached to him Jesus. 36 And as they went along the way, they came to a certain water, and the eunuch said, "See, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?" 37 And Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." And he answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." 38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. 39 And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away so that the eunuch no longer saw him. Then he went on his way rejoicing. 40 But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.

=== Chapter 9

[.outline.text-center]
_Saul, going toward Damascus, is stricken down to the earth and led blind to Damascus, 1-9; is called to the apostleship, 10-17; and is baptized by Ananias, 18, 19. He preaches Christ boldly, 20-22. The Jews lay wait to kill him, 23-28; so do the Grecians, but he escapes both, 29, 30. The church having rest, Peter heals Eneas of paralysis, 31-35; and restores Tabitha to life, 36-43._

1 And Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, 2 And desired from him letters to the synagogues in Damascus so that if he should find any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus, and suddenly there shined around him a light from heaven, 4 And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying to him, "[.woc]#Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?#" 5 And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And the Lord said, "[.woc]#I am Jesus whom you persecute. It is hard for you to kick against the goads.#" 6 And he, trembling and astonished, said, "Lord, what do you wish for me to do?" And the Lord said to him, "[.woc]#Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told to you what you must do.#" 7 And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. 8 And Saul arose from the earth, but when his eyes were opened, he saw no man. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 9 And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.

10 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, "[.woc]#Ananias.#" And he said, "Behold, I am here, Lord." 11 And the Lord said to him, "[.woc]#Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus. For behold, he prays# 12 [.woc]#And has seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in and putting his hand on him so that he might receive his sight.#" 13 Then Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. 14 And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name." 15 But the Lord said to him, "[.woc]#Go, for he is a chosen vessel for me to bear my name before the Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel.# 16 [.woc]#For I will show him what great things he must suffer for my name's sake.#" 17 And Ananias went and entered into the house, and putting his hands on him, said, "Brother Saul, the Lord—even Jesus who appeared to you in the way as you came—has sent me so that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." 18 And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received sight immediately. Then he arose and was baptized. 19 And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul was some days with the disciples who were at Damascus. 20 And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. 21 But all who heard him were amazed, and said, "Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem and came here for that intent so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?" 22 But Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.

23 And after many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him. 24 But their lying in wait was known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him. 25 Then the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket.

26 And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he essayed to join himself to the disciples, but they were all afraid of him and did not believe that he was a disciple. 27 But Barnabas took him, brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. 28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem. 29 And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the Grecians, but they were seeking to slay him. 30 And when the brothers knew, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus.

31 Then the churches had rest throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.

32 And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he also came down to the saints who dwelt at Lydda. 33 And there he found a certain man named Eneas who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed. 34 And Peter said to him, "Eneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Arise, and make your bed." And he arose immediately. 35 And all who dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him and turned to the Lord.

36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha (who by interpretation is called Dorcas). This woman was full of good works and acts of charity which she did. 37 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber. 38 And as Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent to him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. 39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber. And all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them. 40 But Peter put them all forth, kneeled down, and prayed, and turning to the body, said, "Tabitha, arise." She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 41 And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. And when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive. 42 And it was known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 43 And it came to pass, that he stayed many days in Joppa with one, Simon, a tanner.

=== Chapter 10

[.outline.text-center]
_Cornelius, a devout man, being commanded by an angel, sends for Peter, 1-10, who by a vision is taught not to despise the Gentiles, 11-16; and is commanded by the Spirit to go with the messenger to Caesarea, 17-24. Cornelius discloses the occasion of his sending for him, 25-33. As he preaches Christ to Cornelius and his company, 34-43, the Holy Spirit falls on them and they are baptized, 44-48._

1 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called The Italian Band, 2 A devout man and one who feared God with all his house, who gave many alms to the people and always prayed to God. 3 About the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, "Cornelius." 4 And when he looked at him, he was afraid, and said, "What is it, Lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God. 5 And now send men to Joppa and call for one, Simon, whose surname is Peter. 6 He lodges with one, Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea-side. He will tell you what you ought to do." 7 And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius had departed, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually. 8 And when he had declared all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa.

9 On the next day, as they were going on their journey and drew near to the city, Peter went up upon the house-top about the sixth hour to pray. 10 And he became very hungry and wished to eat, but while they made ready, he fell into a trance 11 And saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending to him like a great sheet knit at the four corners being let down to the earth, 12 In which were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, wild beasts, creeping animals, and birds of the air. 13 And there came a voice to him, "Rise, Peter. Kill and eat." 14 But Peter said, "Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean." 15 And the voice spoke to him again the second time, "What God has cleansed, do not call unclean." 16 This was done three times, and the vessel was received back into heaven.

17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house and were standing before the gate. 18 They called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodged there. 19 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men seek you. 20 Arise therefore, go down, and go with them, doubting nothing, for I have sent them." 21 Then Peter went down to the men who were sent to him from Cornelius, and said, "Behold, I am he whom you seek. What is the cause for which you have come?" 22 And they said, "Cornelius the centurion, a just man and one who fears God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for you into his house and to hear words from you." 23 Then he called them in and lodged them. And on the next day, Peter went with them, and some brothers from Joppa accompanied him. 24 And on the next day, they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. 25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him. 26 But Peter took him up, saying, "Stand up. I myself am also a man." 27 And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together. 28 And he said to them, "You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to keep company or come to one of another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. 29 Therefore, I came to you without gainsaying as soon as I was sent for. I ask therefore for what intent you have sent for me."

30 And Cornelius said, "Four days ago I was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, 31 And said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard and your alms are remembered in the sight of God. 32 Send therefore to Joppa and call here Simon, whose surname is Peter. He lodges in the house of one, Simon, a tanner, by the sea-side. When he comes, he will speak to you.' 33 Immediately therefore I sent for you, and you have done well that you have come. Now therefore, we are all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded you by God."

34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, "In truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons. 35 But in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is accepted with him. 36 The word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), 37 You know that word which was published throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached, 38 That God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. 39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they slew and hanged on a tree. 40 God raised him on the third day and showed him openly, 41 Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, even to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that it is he who was ordained by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead. 43 All the prophets give testimony to him, that through his name, whoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins."

44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word. 45 And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the Gentiles also. 46 For they heard them speak in languages and magnify God. Then Peter answered, 47 "Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?" 48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they requested him to stay some days.

_Peter, being accused of going to the Gentiles, 1-4, makes his defense, 5-17; which is accepted, 18. The gospel being spread into Phenice, Cyprus, and Antioch, Barnabas is sent to confirm them, 19-25. The disciples there are first called Christians, 26. They send relief to the brothers in Judea in time of famine, 27-30._

1 And the apostles and brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 2 And when Peter had come to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him, 3 Saying, "You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them." 4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it in order to them, saying, 5 "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain vessel descending, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners, and it even came to me, 6 Upon which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw four-footed beasts of the earth, wild beasts, creeping animals, and birds of the air. 7 And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Arise, Peter. Slay and eat.' 8 But I said, 'Not so, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.' 9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, 'What God has cleansed, do not call common.' 10 And this was done three times. And all were drawn up back into heaven. 11 And behold, immediately there were three men already standing at the house where I was, sent to me from Caesarea. 12 And the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover, these six brothers accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house. 13 And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him, 'Send men to Joppa and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter, 14 Who shall tell you words by which you and all your house shall be saved.' 15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning. 16 Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' 17 If then God gave them the same gift as he did to us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I that I could withstand God?" 18 When they heard these things, they held their peace and glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted repentance to life to the Gentiles."

19 Now those who were dispersed upon the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phenice, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but to the Jews only. 20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus. 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord. 22 Then tidings of these things came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch. 23 When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave to the Lord. 24 For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And many people were added to the Lord. 25 Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus to seek Saul. 26 And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

27 And in these days, prophets from Jerusalem came to Antioch. 28 And one of them named Agabus stood up and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine throughout all the world, which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. 29 Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers who dwelt in Judea, 30 Which they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

_King Herod persecutes the Christians, kills James, and imprisons Peter, whom an angel delivers upon the prayers of the church, 1-19. Herod in his pride, taking to himself the honor due to God, is stricken by an angel and dies miserably, 20-23. After his death, the word of God prospers, 24. Saul and Barnabas return to Antioch, 25._

1 Now about that time, Herod the king stretched forth his hands to afflict some of the church. 2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. 3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. Those were the days of unleavened bread. 4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him, intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people. 5 Peter therefore was kept in prison. But prayer was made without ceasing by the church to God for him.

6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the keepers before the door kept the prison. 7 And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison, and he smote Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, "Arise quickly." And his chains fell off from his hands. 8 And the angel said to him, "Gird yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he says to him, "Put on your cloak and follow me." 9 And he went out and followed him, and did not know that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision. 10 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord. And they went out and passed on through one street, and immediately the angel departed from him. 11 And when Peter had come to himself, he said, "Now I know with certainty that the Lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews." 12 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were assembled and praying. 13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a woman-servant named Rhoda came to listen. 14 And when she knew Peter's voice, she did not open the gate for gladness, but ran in and reported that Peter stood before the gate. 15 And they said to her, "You are insane." But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then they said, "It is his angel." 16 But Peter continued knocking. And when they had opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. 17 But he, beckoning to them with the hand to hold their peace, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Go, show these things to James and to the brothers." And he departed and went into another place.

18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter. 19 And when Herod had sought for him and did not find him, he examined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.

20 And Herod was highly displeased with those of Tyre and Sidon. But they came with one accord to him, and having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace, because their country was nourished by the king's country. 21 And upon a set day, Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne and made an oration to them. 22 And the people gave a shout, saying, "It is the voice of a god and not of a man." 23 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.

24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.

25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.

The Gentiles believe, 42, 43; but the Jews gainsay and blaspheme, whereupon Paul and Barnabas turn to the Gentiles, of whom many believe, 44-49. The Jews raise a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, who go to Iconium, 50-52._

1 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. 2 As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Separate Barnabas and Saul for me for the work to which I have called them." 3 And when they had fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.

4 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, departed to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. 5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they also had John for their minister. 6 And when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Barjesus, 7 Who was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man, who called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the word of God. 8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. 9 Then Saul (who also is called Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him, 10 And said, "O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? 11 And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season." And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand. 12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

13 Now when Paul and his company set sail from from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem. 14 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath and sat down. 15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Men, brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak." 16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand, said, "Men of Israel and you who fear God, give audience. 17 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm he brought them out of it. 18 And about the time of forty years he put up with their manners in the wilderness. 19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot. 20 And after that, he gave judges to them, for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. 21 And afterward, they desired a king, and God gave Saul the son of Kish to them, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. [[act013-022]]22 And when he had removed him, he raised up to them David to be their king, to whom also he gave testimony, and said, '_"I have found David"_ the son of Jesse, _"a man after my own heart"_ who shall fulfill all my will.' 23 Of this man's offspring God has, according to his promise, raised up to Israel a Savior, Jesus. 24 Before his coming, John had first preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, 'Who do you think that I am? I am not he. But behold, there comes one after me whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to untie.'

26 "Men, brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you the word of this salvation is sent. 27 For those who dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know him, nor yet the words of the prophets which are read every sabbath, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. 28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet they desired of Pilate that he should be put to death. 29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulcher. 30 But God raised him from the dead, 31 And he was seen many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people. 32 And we declare to you the glad tidings, that the promise which was made to the fathers, [[act013-033]]33 God has fulfilled the same to us their children in that he has raised up Jesus again, as it is also written in the second psalm,

36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption. 37 But he whom God raised again saw no corruption. 38 May it be known to you therefore, men, brothers, that through this man the forgiveness of sins is preached to you, 39 And by him all who believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses. 40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets,

42 And when the Jews had gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles implored that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. 43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

44 And on the next sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God. 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy and spoke against those things which were uttered by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming. 46 Then Paul and Barnabas became bold, and said, "It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. But seeing you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles. [[act013-047]]47 For thus the Lord has commanded us, saying,

48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. 49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. 50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women and the chief men of the city, raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their borders. 51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came to Iconium. 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

_Paul and Barnabas are persecuted from Iconium, 1-7. At Lystra Paul heals a cripple, whereupon they are reputed as gods, 8-18. Paul is stoned, 19, 20. They pass through various churches, confirming the disciples in faith and patience, 21-25. Returning to Antioch, they report what God had done with them, 26-28._

1 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a way that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. 2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and made their minds evil-affected against the brothers. 3 Therefore, they stayed a long time speaking boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. 4 But the multitude of the city was divided. And part held with the Jews and part with the apostles. 5 And when there was an assault made both by the Gentiles and also by the Jews, with their rulers, to use them despitefully and to stone them, 6 Being apprised of it, they fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the region in that vicinity. 7 And they preached the gospel there.

8 And there sat a certain man at Lystra lacking strength in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb who had never walked. 9 The same heard Paul speak, who, steadfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 10 Said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And he leaped and walked. 11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men." 12 And they called Barnabas, "Zeus," and Paul, "Hermes," because he was the chief speaker. 13 Then the priest of Zeus who was before their city brought oxen and garlands to the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people, 14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they rent their clothes and ran in among the people, crying out, [[act014-015]]15 And saying, "Sirs, why do you do these things? We are also men of like passions with you and preach to you that you should turn from these vanities to the living God, who '_made heaven, earth, the sea, and all things that are in them,_' 16 Who in times past allowed all nations to walk in their own ways. 17 Nevertheless, he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness." 18 And with these sayings they scarcely restrained the people from doing sacrifice to them.

19 And some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, who persuaded the people. And having stoned Paul, they drew him out of the city supposing him to be dead. 20 But as the disciples stood around him, he rose and came into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. 21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch, 22 Confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, "We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God." 23 And when they had ordained elders for them in every church and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, in whom they believed.

24 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. 25 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia. 26 And from there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. 27 And when they had come and had assembled the church, they rehearsed all that God had done with them and that he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles. 28 And there they stayed a long time with the disciples.

_Great dissensions arise concerning circumcision, 1-4. The apostles consult about it, 5-21, and send their determination by letters to the churches, 22-35. Paul and Barnabas, thinking to visit the brothers together, disagree and travel different ways, 36-41._

1 And some men who came down from Judea taught the brothers, and said, "Unless you are circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved." 2 Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul, Barnabas, and some others of them should go to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question. 3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles. And they caused great joy to all the brothers. 4 And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and by the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. 5 But there rose some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses.

6 And the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter. 7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose and said to them, "Men, brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. 8 And God, who knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving the Holy Spirit to them, even as he did to us, 9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 10 Now therefore, why do you test God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as they are."

12 Then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought by them among the Gentiles.

13 And after they held their peace, James answered, saying, "Men, brothers, listen to me. 14 Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take from among them a people for his name. 15 And the words of the prophets agree to this, as it is written,

18 Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world. 19 Therefore, my judgment is that we do not trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God, 20 But that we write to them that they abstain from pollutions of idols, from lewdness, from things strangled, and from blood. 21 For Moses of old time has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath."

22 Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers. 23 And they wrote letters by their hand after this manner: "The apostles, elders, and brothers send greeting to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. 24 Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, 'You must be circumcised and keep the law,' to whom we gave no such commandment, 25 It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 26 Men who have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things by mouth. 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: 29 That you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from lewdness—which if you keep yourselves from you will do well. Farewell."

30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch. And when they had convened the multitude, they delivered the epistle, 31 Which, when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. 32 And Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words and confirmed them. 33 And after they had spent some time there, they were dismissed in peace from the brothers to the apostles. 34 However, it pleased Silas to remain there still. 35 But Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.

36 And some days after, Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit our brothers in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they are." 37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. 38 But Paul did not think it good to take with them him who departed from them in Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work. 39 And the contention was so sharp between them that they departed, separating one from the other. And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus. 40 And Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God. 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the churches.

_Paul, having circumcised Timothy, 1-6, and being called by the Spirit from one country to another, 7-13, converts Lydia, 14, 15, and casts out a spirit of divination, 16-18; for which cause he and Silas are whipped and imprisoned, 19-24. The prison doors are opened. 25-30. The jailer is converted, 31-34, and they are delivered, 35-40._

1 Then he came to Derbe and Lystra, and behold, a certain disciple was there named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewish woman who believed, but his father was a Greek. 2 He was well reported of by the brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium. 3 Paul wished to have him go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those quarters, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep that were ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem. 5 And so the churches were established in the faith and increased in number daily.

6 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia and were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia, 7 After they had come to Mysia, they essayed to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not allow them. 8 And they, passing by Mysia, came down to Troas. 9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia stood there and implored him, saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us." 10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.

11 Therefore, setting sail from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis, 12 And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia and a colony. And we were in that city staying some days. 13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was accustomed to be made, and we sat down and spoke to the women who resorted there.

14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira who worshiped God, heard us, whose heart the Lord opened so that she attended to the things which were spoken by Paul. 15 And when she was baptized, along with her household, she implored us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay there." And she constrained us.

16 And it came to pass as we went to prayer, a certain woman-servant possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying. 17 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, "These men are the servants of the most high God, who show the way of salvation to us." 18 And she did this many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And he came out the same hour.

19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas and drew them into the market-place to the rulers, 20 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, "These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city 21 And teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans."

22 And the multitude rose together against them, and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them. 23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely, 24 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the stocks.

25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises to God, and the prisoners heard them. 26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bonds were loosened. 27 And the keeper of the prison, awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew out his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled. 28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, "Do yourself no harm, for we are all here." 29 Then he called for a light, sprang in, and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas. 30 Then he brought them out, and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"

31 And they said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you and your house shall be saved." 32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. 33 And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes. Then he was baptized—he and all his household—without delay. 34 And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.

35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, "Let those men go." 36 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul: "The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore, depart and go in peace." 37 But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us openly and uncondemned—we being Romans—and have cast us into prison, and now they thrust us out privately? By no means. But let them come themselves and bring us out." 38 And the sergeants told these words to the magistrates, and they feared when they heard that they were Romans. 39 So they came and implored them. And having brought them out, they asked them to depart out of the city. 40 And they went out of the prison and entered into the house of Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them and departed.

_Paul preaches at Thessalonica, where some believe, 1-4, and others persecute him, 5-9. He is sent to Berea and preaches there, 10-12. Being persecuted by Jews from Thessalonica, 13-15, he comes to Athens, disputing with the Jews and preaching the living God, to them unknown, 16-31; whereby, though some mock, many are converted to Christ, 32-34._

1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. 2 And Paul, as his manner was, went to them, and on three sabbaths reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, 3 Opening and alleging that it was needful that Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I preach to you, is Christ." 4 And some of them believed and consorted with Paul and Silas, along with a great multitude of the devout Greeks and many of the chief women. 5 But the Jews who did not believe, being moved with envy, took for themselves some vile fellows of the baser sort, and gathering a company, set all the city in an uproar. They assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people. 6 And when they did not find them, they drew Jason and some brothers to the rulers of the city, crying, "These who have turned the world upside down have come here also, 7 Whom Jason has received, and they all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus." 8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things. 9 And when they had received a pledge from Jason and from the others, they let them go.

10 And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea, who, coming there, went into the synagogue of the Jews. 11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so. 12 Therefore, many of them believed, along with a number of honorable women and men who were Greeks. 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the people. 14 And then immediately the brothers sent Paul away to go as far as to the sea, but Silas and Timothy stayed there still. 15 And those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens, and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.

16 Now, while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. 17 Therefore, he disputed in the synagogue with the Jews and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with those who met with him. 18 Then some philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics encountered him. And some said, "What will this babbler say?" and others said, "He seems to be a proclaimer of strange gods," because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection. 19 And they took him and brought him to Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new doctrine is of which you speak? 20 For you bring some strange things to our ears. We therefore wish to know what these things mean"— 21 For all the Athenians and strangers who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.

22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars-hill, and said, "Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious. 23 For as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription: 'TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.' Therefore, whom you ignorantly worship, I declare him to you. 24 God who made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands, 25 Neither is worshiped with men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he gives to all life, breath, and all things, 26 And has made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth and has determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation, 27 That they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. 28 For in him we live, move, and have our being, as some of your own poets have also said, 'For we are also his offspring.' 29 Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like gold, silver, or stone engraved by art and man's device. 30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, 31 Because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained, of which he has given assurance to all men in that he has raised him from the dead."

32 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, but others said, "We will hear you again concerning this matter." 33 So Paul departed from among them. 34 But some men adhered to him and believed, among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

_Paul labors with his hands and preaches at Corinth to the Gentiles, 1-8. The Lord encourages him in a vision, 9-11. He is accused before Gallio the deputy, but is dismissed, 12-17. Afterward, passing from city to city, he strengthens the disciples, 18-23. Apollos, being more perfectly instructed by Aquila and Priscilla, preaches Christ with great efficacy, 24-28._

1 After these things, Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth. 2 And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome), and he came to them. 3 And because he was of the same occupation, he stayed with them and worked (for by their occupation they were tent-makers), 4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.

5 And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. 6 And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook his clothing and said to them, "May your blood be upon your own heads. I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles." 7 And he departed from there and entered into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house joined close to the synagogue. 8 And Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord with all his house. And many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized. 9 Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision: "[.woc]#Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not hold your peace.# 10 [.woc]#For I am with you, and no man shall lay hands on you to hurt you, for I have many people in this city.#" 11 And he continued there one year and six months teaching the word of God among them.

12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul and brought him to the judgment-seat, 13 Saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law." 14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of wrong, or heinous crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you. 15 But if it is a question of words and names and of your law, you look to it, for I will be no judge of such matters." 16 And he drove them from the judgment-seat. 17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.

18 And Paul remained there for some time, and then took his leave of the brothers and sailed from there into Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow. 19 And he came to Ephesus and left them there. But he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. 20 When they desired him to stay for a longer time with them, he did not consent, 21 But bid them farewell, saying, "I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem. But I will return to you, if God wills." And he sailed from Ephesus.

22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.

23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.

24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. 25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and diligently taught the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him aside and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly. 27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brothers wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he helped them much who had believed through grace. 28 For he mightily convinced the Jews publicly, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

[.outline.text-center]
_Some disciples receive the Holy Spirit after they are baptized in Jesus' name and Paul lays his hands on them, 1-7. The Jews blaspheme his doctrine, which is confirmed by miracles, 8-12. The Jewish exorcists, 13-15, are beaten by the devil, 16-18. Conjuring books are burnt, 19, 20. Demetrius, for love of gain, raises an uproar against Paul, 21-34; which is appeased by the town-clerk, 35-41._

1 And it came to pass, that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper region, came to Ephesus, and finding some disciples, 2 He said to them, "Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed?" And they said to him, "We have not so much as heard whether there is any Holy Spirit." 3 And he said to them, "Into what then were you baptized?" And they said, "Into John's baptism." 4 Then Paul said, "John truly baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in him who should come after him, that is, in Christ Jesus." 5 When they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in languages and prophesied. 7 And they were about twelve men in all.

8 And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. 9 But when some were hardened and did not believe, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one, Tyrannus. 10 And this continued for two years so that all those who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus—both Jews and Greeks.

11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul, 12 So that handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. 13 Then some of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon themselves to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches." 14 And there were seven sons of one, Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, who did so. 15 And the evil spirit answered and said, "Jesus I know and Paul I know, but who are you?" 16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overcame them, and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 17 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus. And fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. 18 And many who believed came, confessed, and showed their deeds. 19 Many of those who also practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them before all men. And they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. 20 So the word of God mightily grew and prevailed.

21 After these things had ended, Paul purposed in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome." 22 So he sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.

23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way. 24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silver-smith who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen, 25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, "Sirs, you know that by this craft we have our wealth. 26 Moreover, you see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods which are made with hands. 27 So not only is this craft of ours in danger to be set at nothing, but also the temple of the great goddess Diana may be despised and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships."

28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath and cried out, saying, "Diana of the Ephesians is great." 29 And the whole city was filled with confusion. And having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theater. 30 And when Paul wished to go in among the people, the disciples did not allow him. 31 And some of the chief of Asia who were his friends sent to him, desiring him that he would not venture himself into the theater. 32 Some therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know why they had come together. 33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand and wished to make his defense to the people. 34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice for about two hours cried out, "Diana of the Ephesians is great." 35 And when the town-clerk had appeased the people, he said, "Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana and of the image which fell down from the sky? 36 Seeing then that these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly. 37 For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. 38 Therefore, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies. Let them accuse one another. 39 But if you inquire anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. 40 For we are in danger of being called in question for this day's uproar, since there is no cause by which we may give an account of this commotion." 41 And when he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.

_Paul goes to Macedonia, and from there to Troas, 1-6. He celebrates the Lord's supper and preaches, 7, 8. Eutychus, having fallen down dead, is raised to life, 9-12. He continues his travels, 13-16; and at Miletus he calls the elders together, tells them what shall happen to him, 17-27, commits God's flock to them, 28, warns them of false teachers, 29-31, commends them to God, 32-35, prays with them, and departs, 36-38._

1 And after the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to him, embraced them, and departed to go into Macedonia. 2 And when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, 3 And stayed there three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. 4 And these accompanied him into Asia: Sopater from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia. 5 These had gone ahead and waited for us at Troas. 6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.

7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them (ready to depart on the next day) and continued his speech until midnight. 8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were assembled. 9 And a certain young man named Eutychus sat in a window, having fallen into a deep sleep. And as Paul discoursed longer still, he sunk down with sleep, fell from the third loft, and was taken up dead. 10 And Paul went down and fell on him, and embracing him, said, "Do not trouble yourselves, for his life is in him." 11 When he had come up again, had broken bread, and eaten, he discoursed a long while, even until break of day, and then departed. 12 And they brought the young man alive and were greatly comforted.

13 And we went before to a ship and sailed to Assos, intending to take in Paul there. For thus he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot. 14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene. 15 And we sailed from there and came the next day over against Chios. And the next day we arrived at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. And the next day we came to Miletus. 16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus because he would not spend the time in Asia, for he hastened, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.

17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church. 18 And when they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, in what manner I was with you the whole time— 19 Serving the Lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews, 20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have shown you and have taught you publicly and from house to house, 21 Testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 22 And now behold, I go bound in the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there, 23 Except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me. 24 But none of these things move me, neither do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

25 "And now behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more. 26 Therefore, I call you to witness this day that I am pure from the blood of all men. 27 For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God. 28 Take heed therefore to yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to feed the church of God which he has purchased with his own blood. 29 For I know this, that after my departure, grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Also from your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them. 31 Therefore, watch, and remember, that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears. 32 And now, brothers, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. 33 I have coveted no man's silver, gold, or apparel. 34 And you yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me. 35 In all things I have shown you that in laboring this way you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"

36 And when he had said this, he kneeled down and prayed with them all. 37 And they all wept bitterly, fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, 38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.

He comes to Jerusalem, 17-26; where he is apprehended and in great danger, but by the chief captain is rescued, 27-36; and requests and is permitted to speak to the people, 37-40._

1 And it came to pass, that after we were separated from them and had launched, we came with a straight course to Coos, and the day following to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. 2 And finding a ship sailing over to Phenicia, we went aboard and set forth. 3 Now when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed into Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her burden. 4 And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days. And through the Spirit they said to Paul that he should not go up to Jerusalem. 5 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and proceeded on our way. And they all conducted us with wives and children until we were out of the city. And we kneeled down on the shore and prayed. 6 And when we had taken our leave of one another, we went on board the ship and they returned home again.

7 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, where we saluted the brothers and stayed with them one day. 8 And the next day, we who were of Paul's company departed and came to Caesarea. And we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. 9 And the same man had four virgin daughters who prophesied. 10 And as we remained there many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 11 And when he had come to us, he took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit: 'Thus the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this girdle and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'" 12 And when we heard these things, both we and those of that place implored him not to go up to Jerusalem. 13 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." 14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "May the will of the Lord be done."

15 And after those days, we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem. 16 Some of the disciples of Caesarea also went with us and brought with them Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.

17 And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. 18 And the day following Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. 19 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. 20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord and said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe, and they are all zealous of the law. 21 And they are informed concerning you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. 22 What is it therefore? It is necessary for the multitude to come together, for they will hear that you have come. 23 Therefore, do what we say to you. We have four men who have a vow on them. 24 Take them, purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them so that they may shave their heads. And all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning you are nothing, but that you yourself also walk orderly and keep the law. 25 As concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, except only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from lewdness." 26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself with them and entered into the temple, declaring the accomplishment of the days of purification until an offering should be offered for each of them.

27 And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews who were from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people and laid hands on him, 28 Crying out, "Men of Israel, help. This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, the law, and this place. And further, he has also brought Greeks into the temple and has polluted this holy place"— 29 For they had seen Trophimus, an Ephesian, with him before in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple. 30 And all the city was moved and the people ran together. And they took Paul and drew him out of the temple. And immediately the doors were shut. 31 And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem was in an uproar, 32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 33 Then the chief captain came near, took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains. Then he inquired who he was and what he had done. 34 And among the multitude some cried one thing, some another. And when he could not know the certainty because of the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle. 35 And when he came upon the stairs, it was so, that he was borne by the soldiers because of the violence of the people. 36 For the multitude of the people followed, crying, "Away with him."

37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said to the chief captain, "May I speak to you?" He said, "Can you speak Greek? 38 Are you not that Egyptian, who, before these days, made an uproar and led out into the wilderness four thousand men who were murderers?" 39 But Paul said, "I am a Jew of Tarsus, a city of Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city, and I implore you to allow me to speak to the people." 40 And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand to the people. And when entire silence was made, he addressed them, speaking in the Hebrew language.

1 "Men, brothers, and fathers, hear my defense which I now make to you"—

2 And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more silent. He says,

3 "I am truly a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, being zealous toward God as you all are this day. 4 And I persecuted this way even to death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women, 5 As also the high priest and all the estate of the elders can bear me testimony. From them I also received letters to the brothers and went to Damascus to bring those who were there bound to Jerusalem to be punished.

6 "And it came to pass, that as I was passing on my journey and had come near to Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light around me. 7 And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?' 8 And I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.' 9 And those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me. 10 And I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Arise, go into Damascus, and there it shall be told to you concerning all things which are appointed for you to do.' 11 And when I could not see because of the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.

12 "And one, Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews who dwelt there, 13 Came and stood by me and said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight.' And the same hour I looked up at him. 14 And he said, 'The God of our fathers has chosen you so that you should know his will, see that Just One, and hear the voice of his mouth. 15 For you shall be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard. 16 And now why do you wait? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.'

17 "And it came to pass, that when I had come to Jerusalem again, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance 18 And saw him saying to me, 'Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.' 19 And I said, 'Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you. 20 And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting to his death and kept the clothing of those who slew him.' 21 And he said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you far from here to the Gentiles.'"

22 And they gave him audience to this word and then lifted up their voices, and said, "Away with such a man from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live." 23 And as they cried out, cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air, 24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and said that he should be examined by scourging so that he might know for what cause they cried like that against him. 25 And as they bound him with straps, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?" 26 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, "Take heed what you do, for this man is a Roman." 27 Then the chief captain came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" He said, "Yes." 28 And the chief captain answered, "With a great sum I obtained this freedom." And Paul said, "But I was born a citizen." 29 Then immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him. And the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a Roman and because he had bound him.

30 On the next day, because he would have known the certainty of why he was accused by the Jews, he released him from his bonds and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear. Then he brought Paul down and set him before them.

_As Paul pleads his cause, 1, Ananias commands them to smite him, 2-6. Dissension among his accusers, 7-10. God encourages him, 11-13. The Jews' laying wait for Paul, 14-19, is declared to the chief captain, 20-26. He sends him to Felix the governor, 27-35._

1 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, "Men, brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day." 2 And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. 3 Then Paul said to him, "God shall smite you, you whited wall. And do you sit to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law command me to be smitten?" 4 And those who stood by said, "Do you revile God's high priest?" [[act023-005]]5 Then Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest. For it is written, '_You shall not speak evil about the ruler of your people._'"

6 But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question." 7 And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided. 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit, but the Pharisees confess both. 9 And there arose a great cry. And the scribes who were from the Pharisees' part arose and contended, saying, "We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God." 10 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing, lest Paul would have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the castle.

11 And the following night, the Lord stood by him, and said, "[.woc]#Be of good cheer, Paul, for as you have testified concerning me in Jerusalem, so you must bear testimony also at Rome.#"

12 And when it was day, some of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul. 13 And they were more than forty who had made this conspiracy. 14 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul. 15 Now therefore, you and the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down to you tomorrow as though you would inquire something more perfectly concerning him. And we, before he comes near, are ready to kill him."

16 And when the son of Paul's sister heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle and told Paul. 17 Then Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said, "Bring this young man to the chief captain, for he has a certain thing to tell him." 18 So he took him and brought him to the chief captain, and said, "Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to bring to you this young man who has something to say to you." 19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately, and asked him, "What is it that you have to tell me?" 20 And he said, "The Jews have agreed to desire of you that you would bring Paul down tomorrow into the council as though they would inquire somewhat more perfectly concerning him. 21 But do not yield to them, for there are of those who lie in wait for him more than forty men who have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. And now they are ready, looking for a promise from you." 22 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, "See that you tell no man that you have revealed these things to me."

23 And he called two centurions to him, saying, "Make ready two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night. 24 And provide for them beasts that they may set Paul on and bring him safe to Felix the governor." 25 And he wrote a letter after this manner:

26 "Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, sends greeting. 27 This man was taken by the Jews and would have been killed by them. But I came with a body of soldiers and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman. 28 And when I would have known the cause for which they accused him, I brought him forth into their council, 29 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death, or of bonds. 30 And when it was told to me that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent immediately to you and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before you what they had against him. Farewell."

31 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. 32 On the next day, they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle. 33 When they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, they also presented Paul before him. 34 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia, 35 He said, "I will hear you when your accusers have also come." And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment-hall.

_Paul, being accused by Tertullus the orator, 1-9, answers for his life and doctrine, 10-23. He preaches Christ to the governor and his wife, 24, 25. The governor hopes for a bribe, but in vain, 26. At last, going out of his office, he leaves Paul in prison, 27._

1 And after five days, Ananias the high priest came down with the elders and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who brought charges to the governor against Paul. 2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by your providence, 3 We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. 4 But so that I may not be further tedious to you, I pray you, that you, of your clemency, would hear us briefly, [[act024-005]]5 For we have found this a pestilent man, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarenes, 6 Who also tried to profane the temple, whom we took and would have judged according to our law. 7 But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took him out of our hands, 8 Commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him, you yourself may take knowledge of all these things of which we accuse him." 9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.

10 Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned to him to speak, answered, "Because I know that you have been for many years a judge to this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself, 11 So that you may understand that there have been no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man; neither exciting the people to sedition, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city; 13 Neither can they prove the things of which they now accuse me. 14 But this I confess to you: that after the way which they call heresy, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets, 15 And having hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. 16 And in this I exercise myself, to always have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men. 17 Now after many years, I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation, 18 Upon which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult, 19 Who ought to have been here before you and object if they had anything against me. 20 Or else, let these same here say if they have found any evil-doing in me while I stood before the council, 21 Unless it is for this one voice that I cried standing among them: 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.'"

22 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, "When Lysias the chief captain comes down, I will know the uttermost of your matter." 23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintances to minister or come to him.

24 And after some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, "Depart for this time. When I have a convenient season, I will call for you." 26 He hoped also that money would have been given to him by Paul so that he might release him. Therefore, he sent for him more often and talked with him. 27 But after two years, Porcius Festus came as successor to Felix. And Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

_The Jews accuse Paul before Festus, 1-7. He answers for himself, 8-10, and appeals to Caesar, 11-13. Afterward, Festus opens his matter to King Agrippa, 14-22; and he is brought forth, 23, 24. Festus clears him of having done anything worthy of death, 25-27._

1 Now when Festus had come into the province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem. 2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews brought charges to him against Paul. And they implored him 3 And desired favor against him that he would summon him to Jerusalem. (They were lying in wait in the way to kill him.) 4 But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart there shortly. 5 "Therefore," he said, "let those who among you are able go down with me and accuse this man, if there is any wickedness in him."

6 And when he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, he sat on the judgment-seat and commanded Paul to be brought. 7 And when he had come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove. 8 Then he answered for himself, "Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar have I committed any offense." 9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, "Will you go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these things before me?" 10 Then Paul said, "I stand at Caesar's tribunal where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews as you very well know. 11 For if I am an offender or have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is none of these things of which these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar." 12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, "Have you appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go."

13 And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to salute Festus. 14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause to the king, saying, "There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix, 15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges to me, desiring to have judgment against him, 16 To whom I answered, 'It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die before he who is accused has met the accusers face to face and has license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.' 17 Therefore, when they had come here, I made no delay. And on the next day, I sat on the judgment-seat and commanded the man to be brought forth, 18 Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed, 19 But had some questions against him of their own superstition and of one, Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. 20 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters. 21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar." 22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I also wish to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he said, "you shall hear him."

23 So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp and had entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city. And at the command of Festus, Paul was brought forth. 24 And Festus said, "King Agrippa and all men who are here present with us, you see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. 25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him, 26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore, I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you, O king Agrippa, so that after examination has been made, I may have something to write. 27 For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not also to signify the crimes laid against him."

_Paul, in the presence of Agrippa, declares his life from his childhood, 1-11; and how miraculously he was converted and called to his apostleship, 12-23. Festus charges him with being mad, to which he answers modestly, 24-27. Agrippa is almost persuaded to be a Christian, 28-30. The whole company pronounces him innocent, 31, 32._

1 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself.

2 "I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before you concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, 3 Especially because I know you to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Therefore, I implore you to hear me patiently.

4 "My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know, 5 Who knew me from the beginning (if they would testify), that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. 6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers, 7 To which promise our twelve tribes, assiduously serving God day and night, hope to come, for which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews. 8 Why is it judged incredible with you if God raises the dead?

9 "I truly thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth, 10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem. And many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests. And when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. 11 And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme, and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.

12 "Upon which, as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, 13 At mid-day, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven surpassing the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me. 14 And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.' 15 And I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said, 'I am Jesus whom you persecute. 16 But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to make you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things in which I will appear to you, 17 Delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you, 18 To open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith that is in me.'

19 "Upon which, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, 20 But declared first to those of Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and do works worthy of repentance. 21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple and tried to kill me. 22 Having therefore obtained help from God, I continue to this day, testifying both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said should come: 23 That Christ should suffer, and that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light to the people and to the Gentiles."

24 And as he was thus speaking for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are beside yourself. Excessive learning makes you insane." 25 But he said, "I am not insane, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. 26 For the king knows of these things, before whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done in a corner. 27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe." 28 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You almost persuade me to be a Christian." 29 And Paul said, "I wish to God that not only you, but also all who hear me this day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."

30 And when he had said this, the king rose, along with the governor, Bernice, and those who sat with them. 31 And when they had gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, "This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds." 32 Then Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar."

_Paul, sailing toward Rome, 1-9, foretells about the danger of the voyage, 10, but is not believed, 11-13. They are tossed to and fro by the tempest, 14-40; and suffer shipwreck, 41-43; yet all come safe to land 44._

1 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band. 2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us. 3 And the next day, we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously treated Paul and gave him liberty to go to his friends to refresh himself. 4 And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. 5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Mira, a city of Lycia. 6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy and he put us therein. 7 And when we had sailed slowly many days and with difficulty had come over against Cnidus, the wind not allowing us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone, 8 And hardly passing it, came to a place which is called The Fair Havens, near to which was the city of Lasea.

9 Now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, 10 And said to them, "Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives." 11 Nevertheless, the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than the things which were spoken by Paul. 12 And because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the greater part advised to depart from there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice and winter there, which is a haven of Crete looking toward the southwest and northwest.

13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they raised the anchor and sailed close by Crete.

14 But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. 15 And when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive. 16 And running under the sheltered side of a small island which is called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat. 17 And when they hoisted it up, they used ropes to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would fall into the quicksands, they struck sail and were thus driven. 18 And as we labored exceedingly with the storm, on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard. 19 And on the third day, we cast out the tackling of the ship with our own hands. 20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.

21 But after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete and gained this harm and loss. 22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of life among you, but of the ship. 23 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am and whom I serve, 24 Saying, 'Do not fear, Paul. You must be brought before Caesar. And behold, God has given you all those who sail with you.' 25 Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer, for I believe God that it will be even as it was told to me. 26 But we must be cast upon a certain island."

27 When the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the sailors suspected that they drew near to some country. 28 They sounded and found it twenty fathoms. And when they had gone a little further, they sounded again and found it fifteen fathoms. 29 Then fearing, lest we should fall upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day. 30 And as the sailors were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea under color as though they would cast anchors out of the foreship, 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved." 32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off.

33 And as the day was about to come, Paul implored them all to take food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that you have waited and continued fasting, having taken nothing. 34 Therefore, I pray you to take some food, for this is for your health. For there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you." 35 And when he had said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all. And when he had broken it, he began to eat. 36 Then they were all of good cheer and they also took food. 37 In all, we were two hundred and seventy-six souls on the ship. 38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and cast the wheat into the sea.

39 And when it was day, they did not know the land. But they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into which they purposed, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. 40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, loosened the rudder ropes, hoisted the mainsail to the wind, and made toward the shore. 41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground. And the forepart stuck firmly and remained immovable, but the back part was broken with the violence of the waves. 42 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out and escape. 43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose and commanded that those who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land, 44 And the rest, some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safely to land.

_Paul, after his shipwreck, is kindly entertained by the barbarians, 1-2. The viper on his hand does not hurt him, 3-6. He heals many diseases on the island, 7-10. They depart toward Rome, 11-16. He declares to the Jews the cause of his coming, 17-23. After his preaching, some were persuaded and some did not believe, 24-29. He preaches there two years, 30, 31._

1 And when they had escaped, they knew that the island was called Melita. 2 And the barbarous people showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and received each of us, because of the present rain and because of the cold. 3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out of the heat and fastened on his hand. 4 And when the barbarians saw the animal hang on his hand, they said among themselves, "No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance does not allow to live." 5 And he shook off the animal into the fire and felt no harm. 6 But they expected that he would have swollen or suddenly fallen down dead. But after they had waited a long time and saw nothing amiss happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.

7 In the neighborhood of that place were lands of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and courteously lodged us for three days. 8 And it came to pass that the father of Publius lay sick with a fever and dysentery, to whom Paul entered in, prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him. 9 So when this was done, others also who had diseases on the island came and were healed, 10 They also honored us with many honors, and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.

11 And after three months, we departed in a ship from Alexandria that had wintered on the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. 12 And landing at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. 13 And from there we made a circuit and came to Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew, and on the second day we came to Puteoli. 14 There we found brothers and were entreated to stay with them seven days. And so we came to Rome. 15 And from there when the brothers heard of us, they came to meet us as far as The Forum of Appii, and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.

16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to dwell by himself, with a soldier who kept him.

17 And it came to pass, that after three days, Paul called together the chief of the Jews. And when they were assembled, he said to them, "Men, brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, 18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go because there was no cause of death in me. 19 But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything to accuse my nation of. 20 For this cause therefore I have called for you to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain." 21 And they said to him, "We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who came reported or spoken any harm about you. 22 But we desire to hear from you, what you think. For as concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against."

23 And when they had appointed him a day, many came to him into his lodging. He expounded to them from morning until evening, testifying about the kingdom of God and persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets. 24 And some believed the things which were spoken and some did not believe. 25 And when they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word: "The Holy Spirit spoke well by Isaiah the prophet to our fathers, [[act028-026]]26 Saying,

28 "May it be known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it." 29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.

30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all who came to him, 31 Preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
