== The Word of the Lord to Jeremiah

*Jeremiah | Ἱερεμίας | ירמיהו*

[#jer001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_The time, 1-3; and the calling of Jeremiah, 4-10. His prophetic visions of an almond rod and a boiling pot, 11-14. His heavy message against Judah, 15, 16. God encourages him with his promise of assistance, 17-19._

1 [_The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,_ 2 _To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign._ 3 _It also came in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month._]

4 Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|5 "Before I formed you in embryo I knew you. [.linebr]#/# +
And before you were born I sanctified you [.linebr]#/# +
and ordained you a prophet to the nations."
|===

6 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I cannot speak, for I am a child." 7 But the LORD said to me,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"Do not say, 'I am a child,' [.linebr]#/# +
for you shall go to all whom I shall send you, [.linebr]#/# +
and whatever I command you, you shall speak.

|
|8 Do not be afraid of their faces, [.linebr]#/# +
for I am with you to deliver you," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.
|===

9 Then the LORD put forth his hand and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.

|
|10 Behold, I have this day set you [.linebr]#/# +
over the nations and over the kingdoms [.linebr]#/# +
to root out, to pull down, [.linebr]#/# +
to destroy, to throw down, [.linebr]#/# +
to build, and to plant."
|===

11 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" And I said, "I see a rod of an almond-tree." 12 Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well. For I will hasten my word to perform it."

13 And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, and its face is toward the north." 14 Then the LORD said to me, "Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. 15 For behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north," says the LORD, "and they shall come and shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls around and against all the cities of Judah. 16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands. 17 Therefore, gird up your loins, arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed at their faces, lest I confound you before them. 18 For behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against her princes, against her priests, and against the people of the land. 19 And they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you," says the LORD, "to deliver you."

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_God, having shown his former kindness, expostulates with the Jews on their causeless and unexampled revolt, 1-13. They are the causes of their own calamities, 14-17. The sins and idolatries of Judah, 18-34. Her confidence is rejected, 35-37._

1 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2 "Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the LORD:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"I remember you, the kindness of your youth, [.linebr]#/# +
the love of your espousals, [.linebr]#/# +
when you went after me in the wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
in a land that was not sown.

|
|3 Israel was holiness to the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and the first-fruits of his increase. [.linebr]#/# +
All who devour him shall offend. [.linebr]#/# +
Evil shall come upon them," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.'"
|===

4 Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob and all the families of the house of Israel. 5 Thus says the LORD:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"What iniquity have your fathers found in me [.linebr]#/# +
that they have gone far from me [.linebr]#/# +
and have walked after vanity and have become vain?

|
|6 They did not say, [.linebr]#/# +
'Where is the LORD who brought us [.linebr]#/# +
out of the land of Egypt, [.linebr]#/# +
who led us through the wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
through a land of deserts and of pits, [.linebr]#/# +
through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, [.linebr]#/# +
through a land that no man passed through [.linebr]#/# +
and where no man dwelt?'

|
|7 And I brought you into a plentiful country [.linebr]#/# +
to eat its fruit and its goodness, [.linebr]#/# +
but when you entered, you defiled my land [.linebr]#/# +
and made my heritage an abomination.

|
|8 The priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?' [.linebr]#/# +
And those who handle the law did not know me. [.linebr]#/# +
The pastors also transgressed against me, [.linebr]#/# +
and the prophets prophesied by Baal [.linebr]#/# +
and walked after things that do not profit.

|
|9 Therefore, I will still plead with you," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"and with your children's children I will plead.

|
|10 For pass over to the coastlands of Chittim and see. [.linebr]#/# +
And send to Kedar and consider diligently [.linebr]#/# +
and see if there is such a thing.

|
|11 Has a nation changed their gods? [.linebr]#/# +
(And yet they are not gods.) [.linebr]#/# +
But my people have changed their glory [.linebr]#/# +
for that which does not profit.

|
|12 Be astonished, O heavens, at this, [.linebr]#/# +
and be horribly afraid, be very desolate," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|13 "For my people have committed two evils: [.linebr]#/# +
they have forsaken me, [.linebr]#/# +
the fountain of living waters, [.linebr]#/# +
and hewed out for themselves cisterns, [.linebr]#/# +
broken cisterns that can hold no water.

|
|14 Is Israel a servant? [.linebr]#/# +
Is he a home-born slave? [.linebr]#/# +
Why is he laid waste?

|
|15 The young lions roared upon him [.linebr]#/# +
and yelled and made his land waste. [.linebr]#/# +
His cities are burned [.linebr]#/# +
without inhabitant.

|
|16 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes [.linebr]#/# +
have broken the crown of your head.

|
|17 Have you not procured this to yourself [.linebr]#/# +
in that you have forsaken the LORD your God [.linebr]#/# +
when he led you by the way?

|
|18 And now what have you to do in the way of Egypt, [.linebr]#/# +
to drink the waters of Sihor? [.linebr]#/# +
Or what have you to do in the way of Assyria, [.linebr]#/# +
to drink the waters of the river?

|
|19 Your own wickedness shall correct you, [.linebr]#/# +
and your backslidings shall reprove you. [.linebr]#/# +
Know therefore, and see that it is an evil and bitter thing [.linebr]#/# +
that you have forsaken the LORD your God [.linebr]#/# +
and that my fear is not in you," [.linebr]#/# +
says the Lord GOD of hosts.

|
|20 "For of old time I have broken your yoke [.linebr]#/# +
and torn off your bonds, [.linebr]#/# +
and you said, 'I will not transgress,' [.linebr]#/# +
when upon every high hill [.linebr]#/# +
and under every green tree [.linebr]#/# +
you wander, playing the harlot.

|
|21 Yet I had planted you a noble vine, [.linebr]#/# +
wholly a right seed. [.linebr]#/# +
How then are you turned into the degenerate plant [.linebr]#/# +
of a strange vine to me?

|
|22 For though you shall wash yourself with lye [.linebr]#/# +
and use much soap, [.linebr]#/# +
yet your iniquity is marked before me," [.linebr]#/# +
says the Lord GOD.

|
|23 "How can you say, 'I am not polluted. [.linebr]#/# +
I have not gone after Baalim'? [.linebr]#/# +
See your way in the valley. [.linebr]#/# +
Know what you have done. [.linebr]#/# +
You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways.

|
|24 A wild donkey used to the wilderness [.linebr]#/# +
that snuffs up the wind at her pleasure, [.linebr]#/# +
in her occasion, who can turn her away? [.linebr]#/# +
All those who seek her will not weary themselves. [.linebr]#/# +
In her month they shall find her.

|
|25 Withhold your foot from being unshod [.linebr]#/# +
and your throat from thirst. [.linebr]#/# +
But you said, 'There is no hope. [.linebr]#/# +
No, for I have loved strangers, [.linebr]#/# +
and after them I will go.'

|
|26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, [.linebr]#/# +
so is the house of Israel ashamed— [.linebr]#/# +
they, their kings, their princes, [.linebr]#/# +
their priests, and their prophets—

|
|27 Saying to a stock, 'You are my father,' [.linebr]#/# +
and to a stone, 'You have brought me forth.' [.linebr]#/# +
For they have turned their back to me and not their face, [.linebr]#/# +
but in the time of their trouble they will say, [.linebr]#/# +
'Arise, and save us.'

|
|28 But where are your gods [.linebr]#/# +
that you have made for yourself? [.linebr]#/# +
Let them arise if they can save you [.linebr]#/# +
in the time of your trouble. [.linebr]#/# +
For according to the number of your cities [.linebr]#/# +
are your gods, O Judah.

|
|29 Why will you plead with me? [.linebr]#/# +
You all have transgressed against me," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|30 "In vain I have smitten your children. [.linebr]#/# +
They have received no correction. [.linebr]#/# +
Your own sword has devoured your prophets [.linebr]#/# +
like a destroying lion.

|
|31 O generation, see the word of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Have I been a wilderness to Israel [.linebr]#/# +
or a land of darkness? [.linebr]#/# +
Why do my people say, 'We are lords. [.linebr]#/# +
We will no longer come to you'?

|
|32 Can a virgin forget her ornaments, [.linebr]#/# +
or a bride her attire? [.linebr]#/# +
Yet my people have forgotten me [.linebr]#/# +
days without number.

|
|33 Why do you trim your way to seek love? [.linebr]#/# +
Therefore, you have also taught the wicked ones your ways.

|
|34 Also in your skirts is found the blood [.linebr]#/# +
of the souls of the poor innocents. [.linebr]#/# +
I have not found it by secret search, [.linebr]#/# +
but upon all these.

|
|35 Yet you say, 'Because I am innocent, [.linebr]#/# +
surely his anger will turn from me.' [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, I will plead with you [.linebr]#/# +
because you say, 'I have not sinned.'

|
|36 Why do you go around so much [.linebr]#/# +
to change your way? [.linebr]#/# +
You shall also be ashamed of Egypt, [.linebr]#/# +
as you were ashamed of Assyria.

|
|37 You shall even go forth from him, [.linebr]#/# +
with your hands upon your head, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD has rejected your confidences, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall not prosper in them."

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_God's great mercy in Judah's vile lewdness, 1-5. Judah is worse than Israel, 6-11. The promises of the gospel to the penitent, 12-19. Israel reproved and called by God, makes a solemn confession of their sins, 20-25._

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|
|1 He says, "If a man puts away his wife, [.linebr]#/# +
and she goes from him [.linebr]#/# +
and becomes another man's, [.linebr]#/# +
shall he return to her again? [.linebr]#/# +
Shall that land not be greatly polluted? [.linebr]#/# +
But you have played the harlot with many lovers, [.linebr]#/# +
yet return again to me," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|2 "Lift up your eyes to the high places and see [.linebr]#/# +
where you have not been lain with. [.linebr]#/# +
In the roads you have sat for them [.linebr]#/# +
like the Arabian in the wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
and you have polluted the land [.linebr]#/# +
with your acts of lewdness and with your wickedness.

|
|3 Therefore, the showers have been withheld [.linebr]#/# +
and there has been no latter rain. [.linebr]#/# +
Yet you had a harlot's forehead [.linebr]#/# +
and you refused to be ashamed.

|
|4 Will you not from this time cry to me, [.linebr]#/# +
'My father, you are the guide of my youth'?

|
|5 'Will he retain his anger forever? [.linebr]#/# +
Will he keep it to the end?' [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, you have spoken [.linebr]#/# +
and done evil things as you could."
|===

6 The LORD also said to me in the days of Josiah the king, "Have you seen what backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot. 7 And I said after she had done all these things, 'Turn to me.' But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. 8 And I saw that for all the causes by which backsliding Israel committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but went and played the harlot also. 9 And it came to pass through the lightness of her lewdness, that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with stocks. 10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly," says the LORD.

11 And the LORD said to me, "The backsliding Israel has justified herself more than treacherous Judah. 12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|'Return, you backsliding Israel,' [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
'And I will not cause my anger to fall upon you, [.linebr]#/# +
for I am merciful,' [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
'and I will not keep anger forever.

|
|13 Only acknowledge your iniquity [.linebr]#/# +
that you have transgressed against the LORD your God, [.linebr]#/# +
scattered your ways to the strangers [.linebr]#/# +
under every green tree, [.linebr]#/# +
and have not obeyed my voice,' [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|14 'Turn, O backsliding children,' [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
'For I am married to you. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will take you one from a city and two from a family, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will bring you to Zion.'
|===

15 "And I will give you pastors according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. 16 And it shall come to pass when you are multiplied and increased in the land in those days," says the LORD, "that they shall no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the LORD,' neither shall it come to mind, neither shall they remember it, neither shall they visit it, neither shall that be done anymore. 17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem, The Throne of the LORD, and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem. They shall not walk anymore after the imagination of their evil heart. 18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together from the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.

19 "But I said,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|'How shall I put you among the children [.linebr]#/# +
and give you a pleasant land, [.linebr]#/# +
a beautiful heritage of the hosts of nations?' [.linebr]#/# +
And I said, 'You shall call me, My Father, [.linebr]#/# +
and shall not turn away from me.'

|
|20 Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, [.linebr]#/# +
so you have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|21 A voice was heard upon the high places, [.linebr]#/# +
weeping and supplications of the children of Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
for they have perverted their way [.linebr]#/# +
and have forgotten the LORD their God.

|
|22 "Return, you backsliding children, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will heal your backslidings." [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold, we come to you, [.linebr]#/# +
for you are the LORD our God.

|
|23 Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills [.linebr]#/# +
and from the multitude of mountains. [.linebr]#/# +
Truly the salvation of Israel [.linebr]#/# +
is in the LORD our God.
|===

24 "For the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth—their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 25 We lie down in our shame, and our disgrace covers us, for we have sinned against the LORD our God—we and our fathers—from our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."

[#jer004%breakable]
=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_God calls Israel by his promise, 1, 2. He exhorts Judah to repentance by fearful judgments, 3-18. A grievous lamentation for Judah, 19-31._

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|1 "If you will return, O Israel," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"return to me. [.linebr]#/# +
And if you will put away your abominations out of my sight [.linebr]#/# +
and not wander,

|
|2 Then you shall swear, 'The LORD lives,' [.linebr]#/# +
in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness. [.linebr]#/# +
And the nations shall bless themselves in him, [.linebr]#/# +
and in him they shall glory."
|===

3 For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"Break up your fallow ground [.linebr]#/# +
and do not sow among thorns.

|
|4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and take away the foreskins of your heart, [.linebr]#/# +
men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
lest my fury come forth like fire [.linebr]#/# +
and burn so that none can quench it [.linebr]#/# +
because of the evil of your doings."

|
|5 Declare in Judah and publish in Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
and say, "Blow the trumpet in the land. [.linebr]#/# +
Cry, gather together, and say, [.linebr]#/# +
'Assemble yourselves, [.linebr]#/# +
and let us go into the fortified cities.'

|
|6 Set up the standard toward Zion. [.linebr]#/# +
Retire, do not stay, [.linebr]#/# +
for I will bring evil from the north, [.linebr]#/# +
and a great destruction.

|
|7 The lion has come up from his thicket, [.linebr]#/# +
and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way. [.linebr]#/# +
He has gone forth from his place [.linebr]#/# +
to make your land desolate. [.linebr]#/# +
Your cities shall be laid waste [.linebr]#/# +
without an inhabitant.

|
|8 For this gird yourself with sackcloth, [.linebr]#/# +
lament, and howl, [.linebr]#/# +
for the fierce anger of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
has not turned back from us."

|
|9 "And it shall come to pass at that day," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"that the heart of the king [.linebr]#/# +
and the heart of the princes shall perish, [.linebr]#/# +
the priests shall be astonished, [.linebr]#/# +
and the prophets shall wonder."
|===

10 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'You shall have peace,' whereas the sword reaches to the soul."

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|11 At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
"A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness [.linebr]#/# +
toward the daughter of my people, [.linebr]#/# +
not to fan, nor to cleanse,

|
|12 Even a full wind from those places shall come to me. [.linebr]#/# +
Now I will also give sentence against them.

|
|13 "Behold, he shall come up as clouds, [.linebr]#/# +
and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind. [.linebr]#/# +
His horses are swifter than eagles. [.linebr]#/# +
Woe to us! For we are laid waste."

|
|14 O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness [.linebr]#/# +
so that you may be saved. [.linebr]#/# +
How long shall your vain thoughts [.linebr]#/# +
lodge within you?

|
|15 For a voice declares from Dan [.linebr]#/# +
and publishes affliction from mount Ephraim.

|
|16 "Make mention to the nations. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, publish against Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
'Watchers come from a far country [.linebr]#/# +
and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.

|
|17 Like keepers of a field [.linebr]#/# +
they are against her on all sides, [.linebr]#/# +
because she has been rebellious against me,' [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|18 Your way and your doings have procured [.linebr]#/# +
these things to you. [.linebr]#/# +
This is your wickedness because it is bitter, [.linebr]#/# +
because it reaches to your heart."

|
|19 My anguish, my anguish! [.linebr]#/# +
I am pained at my very heart. [.linebr]#/# +
My heart makes a noise in me. [.linebr]#/# +
I cannot hold my peace [.linebr]#/# +
because you have heard, O my soul, [.linebr]#/# +
the sound of the trumpet, [.linebr]#/# +
the alarm of war.

|
|20 Destruction upon destruction is cried, [.linebr]#/# +
for the whole land is laid waste. [.linebr]#/# +
Suddenly my tents are ruined, [.linebr]#/# +
and my curtains in a moment.

|
|21 How long shall I see the standard [.linebr]#/# +
and hear the sound of the trumpet?

|
|22 "For my people are foolish, [.linebr]#/# +
they have not known me. [.linebr]#/# +
They are foolish children, [.linebr]#/# +
and they have no understanding. [.linebr]#/# +
They are wise to do evil, [.linebr]#/# +
but to do good they have no knowledge."

|
|23 I beheld the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and behold, it was without form and void, [.linebr]#/# +
and the heavens, and they had no light.

|
|24 I beheld the mountains, and behold, they trembled, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the hills moved lightly.

|
|25 I beheld, and behold, there was no man, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the birds of the heavens had fled.

|
|26 I beheld, and behold, the fruitful place was a wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
and all its cities were broken down [.linebr]#/# +
at the presence of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and by his fierce anger.

|
|27 For thus the LORD has said: [.linebr]#/# +
"The whole land shall be desolate, [.linebr]#/# +
yet I will not make a full end.

|
|28 For this the earth shall mourn [.linebr]#/# +
and the heavens above shall be black. [.linebr]#/# +
For I have spoken it and I have purposed it. [.linebr]#/# +
I will not repent, neither will I turn back from it."

|
|29 The whole city shall flee [.linebr]#/# +
at the noise of the horsemen and bowmen. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall go into thickets [.linebr]#/# +
and climb up upon the rocks. [.linebr]#/# +
Every city shall be forsaken, [.linebr]#/# +
and not a man dwells therein.

|
|30 And when you are laid waste, what will you do? [.linebr]#/# +
Though you clothe yourself with crimson, [.linebr]#/# +
though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, [.linebr]#/# +
though you rend your face with painting, [.linebr]#/# +
in vain you shall make yourself fair. [.linebr]#/# +
Your lovers will despise you. They will seek your life.

|
|31 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, [.linebr]#/# +
and the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child, [.linebr]#/# +
the voice of the daughter of Zion who bewails herself, [.linebr]#/# +
who spreads her hands, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
"Woe is me now! For my soul is wearied [.linebr]#/# +
because of murderers."

[.outline.text-center]
_The judgments of God upon the Jews for their perverseness, 1-6; for their adultery, 7-9; for their impiety, 10-14; for their worship of idols, 15-18; for their contempt of God, 19-24; and for their great corruption in the civil state, 25-29; and ecclesiastical, 30, 31._

|
|1 "Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem. [.linebr]#/# +
And now look, and know, [.linebr]#/# +
and seek in its broad places. [.linebr]#/# +
If you can find a man, [.linebr]#/# +
if there is anyone who executes judgment, [.linebr]#/# +
who seeks the truth, [.linebr]#/# +
then I will pardon it.

|
|2 And though they say, 'The LORD lives,' [.linebr]#/# +
surely they swear falsely."

|
|3 O LORD, are your eyes not upon the truth? [.linebr]#/# +
You have stricken them, [.linebr]#/# +
but they have not grieved. [.linebr]#/# +
You have consumed them, [.linebr]#/# +
but they have refused to receive correction. [.linebr]#/# +
They have made their faces harder than a rock. [.linebr]#/# +
They have refused to return.

|
|4 Therefore, I said, "Surely these are poor. [.linebr]#/# +
They are foolish, [.linebr]#/# +
for they do not know the way of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
nor the judgment of their God.

|
|5 I will go to the great men [.linebr]#/# +
and speak to them, [.linebr]#/# +
for they have known the way of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and the judgment of their God." [.linebr]#/# +
But these have altogether broken the yoke [.linebr]#/# +
and torn off the bonds.

|
|6 Therefore, a lion from the forest shall slay them, [.linebr]#/# +
a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, [.linebr]#/# +
a leopard shall watch over their cities. [.linebr]#/# +
Everyone who goes out from there [.linebr]#/# +

Your children have forsaken me [.linebr]#/# +
and sworn by those who are not gods. [.linebr]#/# +
When I had fed them to the full, [.linebr]#/# +
they committed adultery [.linebr]#/# +
and assembled themselves by troops [.linebr]#/# +
in the harlots' houses.

|
|8 They were as fed horses in the morning. [.linebr]#/# +
Everyone neighed after his neighbor's wife.

says the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
"And shall my soul not be avenged [.linebr]#/# +
on such a nation as this?

but do not make a full end. [.linebr]#/# +
Take away her branches, [.linebr]#/# +

have dealt very treacherously against me," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|12 They have belied the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and said, "It is not he. [.linebr]#/# +
Evil shall not come upon us, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall we see sword nor famine.

|
|13 And the prophets shall become wind, [.linebr]#/# +
and the word is not in them. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus it shall be done to them."

|
|14 Therefore, thus says the LORD God of hosts: [.linebr]#/# +
"Because you speak this word, [.linebr]#/# +
behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, [.linebr]#/# +
and this people wood, and it shall devour them.

|
|15 Behold, I will bring a nation upon you from far, [.linebr]#/# +
O house of Israel," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
"It is a mighty nation, [.linebr]#/# +
it is an ancient nation, [.linebr]#/# +
a nation whose language you do not know, [.linebr]#/# +
neither understand what they say.

|
|16 Their quiver is as an open sepulcher. [.linebr]#/# +
They are all mighty men.

|

which your sons and your daughters should eat. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall eat up your flocks and your herds. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall eat up your vines and your fig-trees. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall impoverish with the sword your fortified cities, [.linebr]#/# +
in which you have trusted.

18 "Nevertheless, in those days," says the LORD, "I will not make a full end with you. 19 And it shall come to pass, when you shall say, 'Why does the LORD our God do all these things to us?' Then you shall answer them, 'As you have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.'

[.outline.text-center]
_The enemies sent against Judah, 1-3; encourage themselves, 4, 5. God animates and directs the besiegers against the guilty city because of their sins, 6-8. The prophet laments the judgments of God because of their sins, 9-17. He proclaims God's wrath, 18-25. He calls the people to mourn for the judgment on their sins, 26-30._

1 "O children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee [.linebr]#/# +
out of the midst of Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
blow the trumpet in Tekoa, [.linebr]#/# +
and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem, [.linebr]#/# +
for evil appears out of the north, [.linebr]#/# +
even great destruction.

2 I have compared the daughter of Zion [.linebr]#/# +
to a beautiful and delicate woman.

3 The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall pitch their tents against her on every side. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall each feed in his place.

4 Prepare war against her. [.linebr]#/# +
Arise, and let us go up at noon. [.linebr]#/# +
Woe to us! For the day departs, [.linebr]#/# +
and the shadows of the evening are lengthened.

5 Arise, and let us go by night [.linebr]#/# +
and destroy her palaces."

6 For thus the LORD of hosts has said: [.linebr]#/# +
"Hew down trees [.linebr]#/# +
and cast a siege-mound against Jerusalem. [.linebr]#/# +
This is the city to be visited. [.linebr]#/# +
There is only oppression in the midst of her.

7 As a fountain casts out her waters, [.linebr]#/# +
so she casts out her wickedness. [.linebr]#/# +
Violence and devastation is heard in her. [.linebr]#/# +
Continually before me are grief and wounds.

8 Be instructed, O Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
lest my soul depart from you, [.linebr]#/# +
lest I make you desolate, [.linebr]#/# +
a land not inhabited."

9 Thus says the LORD of hosts: [.linebr]#/# +
"They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine. [.linebr]#/# +
Turn back your hand [.linebr]#/# +
like a grape-gatherer into the baskets."

10 To whom shall I speak and give warning [.linebr]#/# +
so that they may hear? [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, their ear is uncircumcised [.linebr]#/# +
and they cannot listen. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach. [.linebr]#/# +
They have no delight in it.

11 Therefore, I am full of the fury of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
I am weary with holding in. [.linebr]#/# +
"I will pour it out upon the children abroad [.linebr]#/# +
and upon the assembly of young men together. [.linebr]#/# +
For even the husband with the wife shall be taken, [.linebr]#/# +
the aged with him who is full of days.

12 And their houses shall be turned to others, [.linebr]#/# +
with their fields and wives together, [.linebr]#/# +
for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

13 "For from their least even to their greatest, [.linebr]#/# +
everyone is given to covetousness. [.linebr]#/# +
And from the prophet even to the priest, [.linebr]#/# +
everyone deals falsely.

14 They have also healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, [.linebr]#/# +
saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.

15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? [.linebr]#/# +
No. They were not at all ashamed, [.linebr]#/# +
neither could they blush. [.linebr]#/# +
Therefore, they shall fall among those who fall. [.linebr]#/# +
At the time that I visit them they shall be cast down," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

[[jer006-016]]16 Thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"Stand in the ways and see, [.linebr]#/# +
and ask for the old paths, [.linebr]#/# +
where the good way is, and walk in it. [.linebr]#/# +
Then you shall find rest for your souls. [.linebr]#/# +
But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'

17 Also I set watchmen over you, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
'Listen to the sound of the trumpet.' [.linebr]#/# +
But they said, 'We will not listen.'

18 Therefore, hear, you nations, [.linebr]#/# +
and know, O congregation, what is among them.

19 Hear, O earth. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, I will bring evil upon this people, [.linebr]#/# +
even the fruit of their thoughts, [.linebr]#/# +
because they have not listened to my words [.linebr]#/# +
nor to my law, but have rejected it.

20 For what purpose does incense come to me from Sheba [.linebr]#/# +
and the sweet cane from a distant country? [.linebr]#/# +
Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, [.linebr]#/# +
nor are your sacrifices sweet to me."

21 Therefore, thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people, [.linebr]#/# +
and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them. [.linebr]#/# +
The neighbor and his friend shall perish."

22 Thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold, a people comes from the north country, [.linebr]#/# +
and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.

23 They shall lay hold on bow and spear. [.linebr]#/# +
They are cruel and have no mercy. [.linebr]#/# +
Their voice roars like the sea. [.linebr]#/# +
And they ride upon horses, [.linebr]#/# +
set in array as men for war [.linebr]#/# +
against you, O daughter of Zion."

24 We have heard its fame. Our hands become feeble. [.linebr]#/# +
Anguish has taken hold of us, [.linebr]#/# +
and pain, as of a woman in travail.

25 Do not go forth into the field, [.linebr]#/# +
nor walk by the way, [.linebr]#/# +
for the sword of the enemy [.linebr]#/# +
and fear is on every side.

26 O daughter of my people, gird yourself with sackcloth [.linebr]#/# +
and wallow yourself in ashes. [.linebr]#/# +
Make for yourself a mourning, as for an only son, [.linebr]#/# +
a most bitter lamentation, [.linebr]#/# +
for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.

27 "I have set you as a tower and a fortress among my people [.linebr]#/# +
so that you may know and try their way."

28 They are all grievous revolters, [.linebr]#/# +
walking slanderously. [.linebr]#/# +
They are brass and iron. [.linebr]#/# +
They are all corrupters.

29 The bellows is burned. [.linebr]#/# +
The lead is consumed by the fire. [.linebr]#/# +
The founder melts in vain, [.linebr]#/# +
for the wicked are not plucked away.

30 Men shall call them reprobate silver [.linebr]#/# +
because the LORD has rejected them.

=== Chapter 7

[.outline.text-center]
_Jeremiah is sent to call to true repentance, to prevent the Jews' captivity, 1-7. He rejects their vain confidence, 8-11; by the example of Shiloh, 12-16. He threatens them for their idolatry, 17-20. He rejects the sacrifices of the disobedient, 21-28. He exhorts to mourn for their abominations in Tophet, 29-31; and the judgments for the same, 32-34._

1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 2 "Stand in the gate of the LORD'S house and proclaim this word there, and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, who enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.'" 3 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. 4 Do not trust in lying words, saying, 'The temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD are these.' 5 For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if you thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor, 6 If you do not oppress the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt, 7 Then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, forever and ever.

8 "Behold, you trust in lying words that cannot profit. 9 Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom you do not know, 10 And come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name, and say, 'We are delivered,' in order to do all these abominations? [[jer007-011]]11 Has this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it," says the LORD.

12 "But go now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. 13 And now, because you have done all these works," says the LORD, "and I spoke to you, rising early and speaking, but you did not hear, and I called you, but you did not answer, 14 Therefore I will do to this house which is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. 15 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even all the offspring of Ephraim.

16 "Therefore, do not pray for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me, for I will not hear you. 17 Do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 18 The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven. And they pour out drink-offerings to other gods to provoke me to anger. 19 Do they provoke me to anger?" says the LORD. "Do they not provoke themselves to the shame of their own faces?" 20 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruit of the ground, and it shall burn and shall not be quenched."

21 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Put your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices and eat flesh. 22 For I did not speak to your fathers, nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices. 23 But this thing I commanded them, saying, 'Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. And walk in all the ways that I have commanded you so that it may be well with you.' 24 But they did not listen, nor incline their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward. 25 Since the day that your fathers came forth from the land of Egypt to this day, I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending them. 26 Yet they did not listen to me nor incline their ear, but hardened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.

27 "Therefore, you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall also call to them, but they will not answer you. 28 But you shall say to them,

Truth has perished [.linebr]#/# +
and is cut off from their mouth.

|
|29 Cut off your hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, [.linebr]#/# +
and take up a lamentation on high places, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD has rejected and forsaken [.linebr]#/# +
the generation of his wrath.'

30 "For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight," says the LORD. "They have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to pollute it. 31 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command them, neither did it come into my heart.

32 "Therefore, behold, the days come," says the LORD, "that it shall no longer be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter, for they shall bury in Tophet until there is no place. 33 And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth, and no one shall frighten them away. 34 Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth, the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, for the land shall be desolate."

_The calamity of the Jews, both dead and alive, 1-3. He upbraids their foolish and shameless impenitence, 4-12. He shows their grievous judgment, 13-17; and bewails their desperate estate, 18-22._

1 "At that time," says the LORD, "they shall bring the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of the princes, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of their graves, 2 And they shall spread them before the sun, the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, whom they have served, after whom they have walked, whom they have sought, and whom they have worshiped.

25 "Behold, the days come," says the LORD, "that I will punish all those who are circumcised with the uncircumcised: 26 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the children of Ammon, Moab, and all who are in the utmost corners who dwell in the wilderness. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart."

_Jeremiah proclaims God's covenant, 1-7; rebukes the Jews' disobeying thereof, 8-10; prophesies evils to come upon them, 11-17; and upon the men of Anathoth for conspiring to kill him, 18-23._

1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 2 "Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 3 And say to them, 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel: "Cursed is the man who does not obey the words of this covenant, 4 Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, 'Obey my voice and do according to all which I command you. Then you shall be my people, and I will be your God,' 5 So that I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day."'" Then I answered, and said, "So be it, O LORD."

6 Then the LORD said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, 'Hear the words of this covenant and do them. 7 For I earnestly testified to your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and testifying, saying, "Obey my voice." 8 Yet they did not obey nor incline their ear, but each walked in the imagination of his evil heart. Therefore, I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant which I commanded them to do, but they did not do them.'"

9 And the LORD said to me, "A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 10 They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers who refused to hear my words, and they went after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers." 11 Therefore, thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape. And though they shall cry to me, I will not listen to them. 12 Then the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem shall go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense, but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble. 13 For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah, and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.

14 "Therefore, do not pray for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them, for I will not hear them in the time when they cry to me for their trouble.

21 Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth who seek your life, saying, "Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD so that you do not die by our hand." 22 Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: "Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword.

14 Thus says the LORD against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: "Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. 15 And it shall come to pass after I have plucked them out, that I will return and have compassion on them and will bring them back, every man to his heritage and every man to his land. 16 And it shall come to pass, that if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, 'The LORD lives,' as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built in the midst of my people. 17 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation," says the LORD.

_By the type of a linen girdle hidden at the Euphrates, God prefigures the destruction of his people, 1-11. Under the parable of the bottles filled with wine, he foretells their drunkenness in misery, 12-14. He exhorts to prevent their future judgments, 15-21. He shows their abominations are the cause thereof, 23-27._

1 Thus says the LORD to me: "Go and get for yourself a linen girdle and put it upon your loins, and do not put it in water." 2 So I procured a girdle according to the word of the LORD and put it on my loins. 3 And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, 4 "Take the girdle that you have procured, which is upon your loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock." 5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the LORD commanded me. 6 And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates and take the girdle from there which I commanded you to hide there." 7 Then I went to the Euphrates, dug, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it, and behold, the girdle was marred. It was profitable for nothing.

8 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 9 "Thus says the LORD: 'After this manner I will mar the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. 10 This evil people who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. 11 For as the girdle cleaves to the loins of a man, so I have caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah,' says the LORD, 'so that they might be to me for a people, for a name, for praise, and for glory. But they would not hear.'

12 "Therefore, you shall speak to them this word: 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel: "Every bottle shall be filled with wine."' And they shall say to you, 'Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?' 13 Then you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit upon David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness. 14 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together," says the LORD.

13 Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD!

10 Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me, a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor have men lent to me on usury, yet every one of them curses me. 11 The LORD said, "Truly it shall be well with your remnant. Truly I will cause the enemy to treat you well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. 12 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? 13 Your substance and your treasures I will give as plunder without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders. 14 And I will make you to pass with your enemies into a land which you do not know, for a fire is kindled in my anger which shall burn upon you."

[.outline.text-center]
_The prophet, under the types of abstaining from marriage, from houses of mourning, and feasting, foretells the utter ruin of the Jews, 1-9; because they were worse than their fathers, 10-13. Their return from captivity shall be stranger than their deliverance out of Egypt, 14, 15. God will doubly recompense their idolatry, 16-21._

1 The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, 2 "You shall not take a wife for yourself, neither shall you have sons nor daughters in this place." 3 For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and the daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them and their fathers who begot them in this land: 4 "They shall die by grievous deaths. They shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried, but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth. And they shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, and their carcasses shall be food for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth."

5 For thus says the LORD: "Do not enter into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them, for I have taken away my peace from this people," says the LORD, "even loving-kindness and mercies. 6 Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them; 7 Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. 8 Also you shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and to drink." 9 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your days the voice of mirth, the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.

10 "And it shall come to pass when you tell this people all these words, that they shall say to you, 'Why has the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?' 11 Then you shall say to them, 'Because your fathers have forsaken me,' says the LORD, 'and have walked after other gods, served them, and worshiped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law, 12 And you have done worse than your fathers, for, behold, you all walk after the imagination of your evil heart so that you do not listen to me. 13 Therefore, I will cast you out of this land into a land that you do not know, neither you nor your fathers, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, where I will not show you favor.'

14 "Therefore, behold, the days come," says the LORD, "that it shall no longer be said, 'The LORD lives, who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt,' 15 But, 'The LORD lives, who brought the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where he had driven them.' And I will bring them back into their land that I gave to their fathers.

16 "Behold, I will send for many fishermen," says the LORD, "and they shall fish them. And afterward, I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. 17 For my eyes are upon all their ways. They are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from my eyes. 18 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double because they have defiled my land. They have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things."

neither shall cease from yielding fruit.

|
|9 The heart is deceitful above all things [.linebr]#/# +
and desperately wicked. Who can know it?

|
|10 I, the LORD, search the heart. [.linebr]#/# +
I try the mind, [.linebr]#/# +
even to give every man according to his ways [.linebr]#/# +
and according to the fruit of his doings.

all who forsake you shall be ashamed, [.linebr]#/# +

19 Thus the LORD said to me: "Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem, 20 And say to them, 'Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates. 21 Thus says the LORD: "Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; 22 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day; neither do any work, but hallow the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. 23 But they did not obey nor incline their ear, but made their neck stiff so that they might not hear nor receive instruction.

24 "And it shall come to pass, that if you diligently listen to me," says the LORD, "to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day and do no work therein, 25 Then there shall enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses—they and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—and this city shall remain forever. 26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, from the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the plain, from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt-offerings, sacrifices, food-offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise to the house of the LORD. 27 But if you will not listen to me to hallow the sabbath day and to bear no burdens while entering at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem and shall not be quenched."'"

1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 2 "Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear my words." 3 Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. 4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter. So he made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make it.

5 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 6 "O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does?" says the LORD. "Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so you are in my hand, O house of Israel. 7 The instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up, to pull down, and to destroy it, 8 If that nation against which I have pronounced turns from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them. 9 And the instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it, 10 If it does evil in my sight so that it does not obey my voice, then I will repent of the good with which I said I would benefit them. 11 Now therefore, come, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the LORD: "Behold, I frame evil against you and devise a device against you. Now each of you return from his evil way and make your ways and your doings good."' 12 And they said, 'There is no hope, but we will walk after our own devices and will each do the imagination of his evil heart.'

Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whoever hears, his ears shall tingle, 4 Because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have burned incense in it to other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents. 5 They have also built the high places of Baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt-offerings to Baal, which I did not command nor speak it, neither did it come into my mind. 6 Therefore, behold, the days come," says the LORD, "that this place shall no longer be called Tophet, nor The Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but The Valley of Slaughter. 7 And I will make the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem void in this place. And I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those who seek their lives. And their carcasses I will give to be food for the birds of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth. 8 And I will make this city desolate and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it shall be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues. 9 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall each eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and distress with which their enemies and those who seek their lives shall distress them."'

10 "Then you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who go with you, 11 And shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel that cannot be made whole again. And they shall bury them in Tophet until there is no place to bury. 12 Thus I will do to this place," says the LORD, "and to its inhabitants, and even make this city like Tophet. 13 And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled like the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven and have poured out drink-offerings to other gods."'"

14 Then Jeremiah came from Tophet, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house and said to all the people, 15 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks so that they might not hear my words.'"

1 Thus says the LORD: "Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak this word there, 2 And say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits upon the throne of David—you, your servants, and your people who enter by these gates. 3 Thus says the LORD: "Execute judgment and righteousness, and deliver him who is laid waste out of the hand of the oppressor. And do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place. 4 For if you do this thing indeed, then there shall enter by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses—he, his servants, and his people. 5 But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself," says the LORD, "that this house shall become a desolation."'" 6 For thus says the LORD to the king's house of Judah:

25 "I have heard what the prophets said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, 'I have dreamed. I have dreamed.' 26 How long?

_Under the type of good and bad figs, 1-3, he foretells the restoration of those who were in captivity, 4-7; and the desolation of Zedekiah and the rest, 8-10._

1 The LORD showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, the princes of Judah, and the carpenters and smiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon. 2 One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe, and the other basket had very poor figs, which could not be eaten they were so bad. 3 Then the LORD said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I said, "Figs. The good figs, very good, and the bad, very bad, which cannot be eaten they are so bad."

4 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 5 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: 'Like these good figs, so I will acknowledge those who are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good. 6 For I will set my eyes upon them for good and bring them back to this land. And I will build them and not pull them down. And I will plant them and not pluck them up. 7 And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart.

8 'And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten they are so bad,' surely thus says the LORD: 'So I will give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, his princes, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt. 9 And I will make them a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them. 10 And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.'"

_Jeremiah, reproving the Jews' disobedience to the prophets, 1-7, foretells the seventy years' captivity, 8-11; and after that, the destruction of Babylon, 12-14. Under the type of a cup of wine he foretells the destruction of all nations, 15-33. The howling of the shepherds, 34-38._

1 A word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), 2 Which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 3 "From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even to this day, that is the twenty-third year, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, but you have not listened. 4 And the LORD has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear. 5 They said, 'Turn back now each from his evil way and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD has given to you and to your fathers forever and ever, 6 And do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, and I will do you no hurt.' 7 Yet you have not listened to me," says the LORD, "so that you might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.

8 "Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: 'Because you have not heard my words, 9 Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,' says the LORD, 'and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around, and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment, a hissing, and perpetual desolations. 10 Moreover, I will take from them the voice of mirth, the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle. 11 And this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment. And these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.

12 'And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,' says the LORD, 'for their iniquity, the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations. 13 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. 14 For many nations and great kings shall also reduce them to subjection. And I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands.'"

15 For thus says the LORD God of Israel to me: "Take the wine cup of this fury from my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it. 16 And they shall drink and be moved and enraged because of the sword that I will send among them."

17 Then I took the cup from the LORD'S hand and made all the nations to drink, to whom the LORD had sent me, 18 Namely, Jerusalem, the cities of Judah, her kings, and her princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day; 19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, and all his people, 20 And all the mingled people; all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Azzah, Ekron, the remnant of Ashdod; 21 Edom, Moab, the children of Ammon; 22 All the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Zidon, the kings of the coastlands which are beyond the sea; 23 Dedan, Tema, Buz, all who are in the utmost corners; 24 All the kings of Arabia, all the kings of the mingled people who dwell in the desert; 25 All the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, all the kings of the Medes; 26 All the kings of the north, far and near, with one another, and all the kingdoms of the world which are upon the face of the earth. And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.

27 "Therefore, you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Drink, be drunken, vomit, fall, and rise no more because of the sword which I will send among you."' 28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: "You shall certainly drink. 29 For behold, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not be unpunished, for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth," says the LORD of hosts.'

1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, this word from the LORD came, saying, 2 "Thus says the LORD: 'Stand in the court of the LORD'S house and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD'S house, all the words that I command you to speak to them. Do not diminish a word. 3 It may be that they will listen and each turn from his evil way so that I may repent of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.' 4 And you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: "If you will not listen to me to walk in my law which I have set before you, 5 To listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I have sent to you, both rising early and sending them, but you have not listened, 6 Then I will make this house like Shiloh and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth."'"

7 So the priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. 8 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests, the prophets, and all the people took him, saying, "You shall surely die. 9 Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, 'This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant'?" And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.

10 When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house. 11 Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, "This man is worthy to die, for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears."

12 Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard. 13 Now therefore, amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will repent of the evil that he has pronounced against you. 14 As for me, behold, I am in your hand. Do with me as it seems good and proper to you. 15 But know for certain, that if you put me to death, you will surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and upon its inhabitants. For of a truth the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears."

16 Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, "This man is not worthy to die, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God." 17 Then some of the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying, 18 "Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts:

19 "Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and implore the LORD, and the LORD repented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus we might procure great evil against our souls."

20 And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah. 21 And when Jehoiakim the king and all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Urijah heard it, he was afraid and fled and went into Egypt. 22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor and some men with him into Egypt. 23 And they brought forth Urijah from Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.

8 'And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and which will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish,' says the LORD, 'with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence until I have consumed them by his hand. 9 Therefore, do not listen to your prophets, to your diviners, to your dreamers, to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers who speak to you, saying, "You shall not serve the king of Babylon." 10 For they prophesy a lie to you to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and you should perish. 11 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, those I will let remain in their own land,' says the LORD, 'and they shall till it and dwell in it.'"'"

12 I also spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, "Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, serve him and his people, and live. 13 Why will you die—you and your people—by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 14 Therefore, do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon,' for they prophesy a lie to you. 15 For I have not sent them," says the LORD, "yet they prophesy a lie in my name so that I might drive you out and that you might perish—you and the prophets who prophesy to you."

16 Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: 'Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, "Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly be brought back from Babylon," for they prophesy a lie to you. 17 Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city be laid waste? 18 But if they are prophets and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts so that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem do not go to Babylon. 19 For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels that remain in this city, 20 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— 21 Indeed, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: 22 "They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall be until the day that I visit them," says the LORD. "Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place."'"

_Hananiah prophesies falsely the return of the vessels and of Jeconiah, 1-4. Jeremiah, wishing it to be true, shows that the event will declare the true prophets, 5-9. Hananiah breaks Jeremiah's yoke, 10, 11. Jeremiah tells of an iron yoke, 12-14; and foretells Hananiah's death, 15-17._

1 And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, 2 "Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, 'I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 3 Within two full years I will bring back into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon. 4 And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah with all the captives of Judah who went into Babylon,' says the LORD. 'For I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'"

5 Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of the LORD, 6 Even the prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen. May the LORD do so. May the LORD perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the LORD'S house and all that is carried away captive from Babylon into this place. 7 Nevertheless, now hear this word that I speak in your ears and in the ears of all the people. 8 The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms concerning war, evil, and pestilence. 9 The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, the prophet shall be known that the LORD has truly sent him."

10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck and broke it. 11 And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, "Thus says the LORD: 'Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years.'" And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.

12 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 13 "Go and tell Hananiah, saying, 'Thus says the LORD: "You have broken the yokes of wood, but you shall make for them yokes of iron." 14 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations so that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him. And I have given him the beasts of the field also."'" 15 Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, "Hear now, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, but you make this people to trust in a lie. 16 Therefore, thus says the LORD: 'Behold, I will cast you from off the face of the earth. This year you shall die because you have taught rebellion against the LORD.'"

17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.

_Jeremiah sends a letter to the captives in Babylon to be quiet there, 1-7, and not to believe the dreams of their prophets, 8, 9; and that they shall return with grace after seventy years, 10-14. He foretells the destruction of the rest for their disobedience, 15-19. He shows the fearful end of Ahab and Zedekiah, two lying prophets, 20-23. Shemaiah writes a letter against Jeremiah, 24-29. Jeremiah foretells his doom, 30-32._

1 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders who were carried away as captives, to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon 2 (After Jeconiah the king, the queen, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the carpenters, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem) 3 By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), saying, 4 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all who are carried away as captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon: 5 'Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit. 6 Take wives and beget sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands so that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there and do not be diminished. 7 And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away as captives, and pray to the LORD for it, for in its peace you shall have peace.' 8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are in the midst of you deceive you, neither listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed, 9 For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them,' says the LORD.

10 "For thus says the LORD: 'After seventy years is accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. 11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,' says the LORD, 'thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. 12 Then you shall call upon me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 13 And you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart. 14 And I will be found by you,' says the LORD, 'and I will turn away your captivity and gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you,' says the LORD, 'and I will bring you back into the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.'

15 "Because you have said, 'The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,' 16 Know that thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits upon the throne of David, concerning all the people who dwell in this city, and concerning your brothers who have not gone forth with you into captivity— 17 Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence and will make them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so bad. 18 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them, 19 For they have not listened to my words,' says the LORD, 'which I sent to them by my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, but you would not hear,' says the LORD. 20 Hear therefore the word of the LORD, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon. 21 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name: 'Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall slay them before your eyes. 22 And concerning them a curse shall be taken up by all the captivity of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, "May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire, 23 Because they have committed villainy in Israel and have committed adultery with their neighbor's wives, and have spoken lying words in my name which I have not commanded them. Even I know and am a witness," says the LORD.'"

24 Thus you shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, 25 "Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, 'Because you have sent letters in your name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, 26 "The LORD has made you priest in place of Jehoiada the priest, so that you should be officers in the house of the LORD. For every man who is mad and makes himself a prophet, you should put him in prison and in the stocks. 27 Now therefore, why have you not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth who makes himself a prophet to you? 28 For therefore he sent to us in Babylon, saying, 'This captivity is long. Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit.'"'"

29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. 30 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 31 "Send to all those of the captivity, saying, 'Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: "Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I did not send him, and he caused you to trust in a lie," 32 Therefore, thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring. He shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people," says the LORD, "because he has taught rebellion against the LORD."'"

1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 2 "Thus speaks the LORD God of Israel, saying, 'Write for yourself all the words that I have spoken to you in a book. 3 For behold, the days come,' says the LORD, 'that I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,' says the LORD, 'and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.'"

yet I will not make a full end of you. [.linebr]#/# +
But I will correct you in measure [.linebr]#/# +

'Your bruise is incurable [.linebr]#/# +

For your wound, you have no healing medicines.

They do not seek you, [.linebr]#/# +
for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, [.linebr]#/# +
with the chastisements of a cruel one, [.linebr]#/# +
for the multitude of your iniquity [.linebr]#/# +
because your sins were increased.

Your sorrow is incurable [.linebr]#/# +

Because your sins were increased, [.linebr]#/# +
I have done these things to you.

says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
'because they called you an outcast, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
"This is Zion, whom no man seeks after."'

'Behold, I will bring back the captivity of Jacob's tents [.linebr]#/# +

a continuing whirlwind. [.linebr]#/# +
It shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.

1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. 2 For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house, 3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had confined him, saying, "Why do you prophesy, and say, 'Thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it. 4 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes. 5 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him," says the LORD. "Though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper"'?"

6 And Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me, saying, 7 'Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, "Buy for yourself my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it."' 8 So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison, according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, 'Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin, for the right of inheritance is yours and the redemption is yours. Buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.

9 "And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son that was in Anathoth and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. 10 And I signed the contract and sealed it, took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. 11 So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open, 12 And I gave the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison. 13 And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 14 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both that which is sealed and this evidence which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel so that they may remain many days." 15 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land."'

16 "Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying, 17 'Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and out-stretched arm, and there is nothing too hard for you. 18 You show loving-kindness to thousands and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them. The Great, the Mighty God, YAHWEH of Hosts, is his name, 19 Great in counsel and mighty in work. For your eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men to give each according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings. 20 You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among other men, and have made yourself a name, as at this day. 21 You have brought forth your people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs, with wonders, with a strong hand, with an out-stretched arm, and with great terror. 22 You have given them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey, 23 And they came in and possessed it, but they did not obey your voice nor walk in your law. They have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do; therefore, you have caused all this evil to come upon them. 24 Behold the siege-mounds, they have come to the city to take it, and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the pestilence. And what you have spoken has come to pass, and behold, you see it. 25 And you have said to me, O Lord GOD, "Buy yourself the field for money and take witnesses," for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.'"

26 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 27 "Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for me?" 28 Therefore, thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it. 29 And the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink-offerings to other gods to provoke me to anger. 30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done evil only before me from their youth, for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands," says the LORD. 31 "For this city has been to me as a provocation of my anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even to this day so that I should remove it from before my face, 32 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 33 And they have turned the back to me and not the face. Though I taught them, rising early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction. 34 But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to defile it. 35 And they built the high places of Baal which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I did not command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination to cause Judah to sin.

36 "And now therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which you say, 'It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence': 37 'Behold, I will gather them out of all countries where I have driven them in my anger, in my fury, and in great wrath, and I will bring them back to this place and cause them to dwell in safety. 38 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 39 And I will give them one heart and one way so that they may fear me forever for their good and the good of their children after them. 40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts so that they shall not depart from me. 41 Indeed, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.' 42 For thus says the LORD: 'As I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I have promised them. 43 And fields shall be bought in this land, of which you say, "It is desolate without man or beast. It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans." 44 Men shall buy fields for money, sign evidences and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south, for I will cause their captivity to return,' says the LORD."

_God promises to the captivity a gracious return, 1-8; a joyful state, 9-11; a settled government, 12-14; Christ the branch of righteousness, 15, 16; a continuance of kingdom and priesthood, 17, 18; and the stability of a blessed posterity, 19-26._

1 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time while he was still confined in the court of the prison, saying, 2 "Thus says the LORD, the maker of this, the LORD who formed it to establish it, Yahweh is his name: 3 'Call to me, and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things which you do not know.' 4 For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the siege-mounds and by the sword: 5 'They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. 6 Behold, I will bring it health and healing. I will cure them and will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth. 7 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return and will build them, as at the first. 8 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against me, and I will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned and by which they have transgressed against me. 9 And it shall be to me for a name of joy, for praise, and for honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them. And they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure to it.'

10 "Thus says the LORD: 'Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man, without inhabitant, and without beast, 11 The voice of joy, the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, the voice of the bride, and the voice of those who shall say, "Praise the LORD of hosts, for the LORD is good. For his mercy endures forever," and of those who shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return, as at the first,' says the LORD.

12 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all its cities shall be a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. 13 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the valley, in the cities of the south, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks shall pass again under the hands of him who counts them,' says the LORD.

14 'Behold, the days come,' says the LORD, 'that I will perform that good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. 15 In those days and at that time I will cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David, and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land. 16 In those days Judah shall be saved and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety. And this is the name by which she shall be called: YAHWEH Our Righteousness.' 17 For thus says the LORD: 'David shall never lack a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel, 18 Neither shall the priests the Levites lack a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, to kindle food-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.'"

19 And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 20 "Thus says the LORD: 'If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night so that there should not be day and night in their season, 21 Then may my covenant also be broken with David my servant so that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne, and also with the Levites the priests, my ministers. 22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.'"

23 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 24 "Do you not consider what this people has spoken, saying, 'The two families which the LORD has chosen, he has even cast them off'? Thus they have despised my people so that they should no longer be a nation before them. 25 Thus says the LORD: 'If my covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth, 26 Then I will cast away the offspring of Jacob and David my servant so that I will not take any of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will cause their captivity to return and have mercy on them.'"

_Jeremiah prophesies the captivity of Zedekiah and the city, 1-7. The princes and the people, having dismissed their servants, cause them to return contrary to the covenant of God, 8-11. Jeremiah gives them and Zedekiah into the hands of their enemies for their disobedience, 12-22._

1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, all his army, all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people fought against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying, 2 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: 'Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, "Thus says the LORD: 'Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. 3 And you shall not escape from his hand, but shall surely be taken and delivered into his hand. And your eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.'"' 4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah. Thus says the LORD concerning you: 'You shall not die by the sword, 5 But you shall die in peace. And as with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they shall burn odors for you. And they will lament you, saying, "Ah, lord!"' For I have pronounced the word," says the LORD.

6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem 7 When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah, for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah.

8 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem to proclaim liberty to them, 9 That every man should liberate his man-servant and every man his woman-servant, being a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, so that no one should retain them in service, namely, a Jew his brother. 10 Now when all the princes and all the people who had entered into the covenant heard that everyone should liberate his man-servant and everyone his woman-servant so that no one should retain them in service anymore, they obeyed and let them go. 11 But afterward, they turned and caused the men-servants and the women-servants whom they had liberated to return, and brought them into subjection as men-servants and as women-servants.

12 Therefore, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 13 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: 'I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying, 14 "At the end of seven years each of you shall dismiss his brother, a Hebrew, who has been sold to you. And when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you." But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ear. 15 And you had now turned and had done right in my sight, each in proclaiming liberty to his neighbor, and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name. 16 But you turned and profaned my name and each caused his man-servant and each his woman-servant, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection to be your men-servants and women-servants.'

17 "Therefore, thus says the LORD: 'You have not listened to me in proclaiming liberty, each to his brother and each to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim a liberty for you,' says the LORD, 'to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine, and I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. 18 And I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts— 19 The princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf— 20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth. 21 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which have gone up from you. 22 Behold, I will command,' says the LORD, 'and cause them to return to this city, and they shall fight against it, take it, and burn it with fire. And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.'"

_By the obedience of the Rechabites, 1-11, Jeremiah condemns the disobedience of the Jews, 12-17. God blesses the Rechabites for their obedience, 18, 19._

1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 2 "Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink." 3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah the son of Habaziniah, his brothers, all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites, 4 And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, who was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door. 5 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine and cups, and I said to them, "Drink wine." 6 But they said, "We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, 'You shall drink no wine—neither you nor your sons forever— 7 Neither shall you build house, sow seed, plant vineyard, nor have any. But all your days you shall dwell in tents so that you may live many days in the land where you are strangers.' 8 Thus we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he has charged us, to drink no wine all our days—we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters— 9 Nor to build houses for us to dwell in, neither do we have vineyard, field, nor seed. 10 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 11 But it came to pass when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, 'Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians.' So we dwell at Jerusalem."

12 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 13 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, "Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words?" says the LORD. 14 "The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons not to drink wine are performed. For to this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment. But I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, and you did not listen to me. 15 I have also sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, 'Return each of you now from his evil way, amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But you have not inclined your ear nor listened to me. 16 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me,'"' 17 Therefore, thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard, and I have called to them, but they have not answered.'"

18 And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he has commanded you, 19 Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before me forever."'"

_Jeremiah causes Baruch to write his prophecy, 1-4, and publicly to read it, 5-10. The princes, having intelligence thereof by Michaiah, send Jehudi to fetch the scroll and read it, 11-18. They make Baruch hide himself and Jeremiah, 19. The king Jehoiakim, being certified thereof, hears part of it and burns the scroll, 20-26. Jeremiah denounces his judgment, 27-31. Baruch writes a new copy, 32._

1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 2 "Take for yourself a scroll of a book and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, against Judah, and against all the nations from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day. 3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them so that they may each return from his evil way and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."

4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah. And Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD which he had spoken to him upon a scroll of a book. 5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, "I am confined. I cannot go into the house of the LORD. 6 Therefore, go and read the words of the LORD from the scroll which you have written from my mouth in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the day of fasting. And also you shall read them in the ears of all of Judah who come out of their cities. 7 It may be that they will present their supplication before the LORD and will each return from his evil way, for the anger and the fury is great that the LORD has pronounced against this people." 8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house.

9 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem and to all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem. 10 Then Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people.

11 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD, 12 He went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber, and behold, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 13 Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 14 Therefore, all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, "Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people and come." So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them. 15 And they said to him, "Sit down now and read it in our ears." So Baruch read it in their ears. 16 Now it came to pass when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear to one another and said to Baruch, "We will surely tell the king of all these words." 17 And they asked Baruch, saying, "Tell us now, how did you write all these words from his mouth?" 18 Then Baruch answered them, "He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book." 19 Then the princes said to Baruch, "Go, hide yourself—you and Jeremiah—and let no man know where you are."

20 And they went to the king in the court, but they laid up the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe and told all the words in the ears of the king. 21 So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king. 22 Now the king sat in the winter-house in the ninth month, and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him. 23 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the scribe's pen-knife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. 24 Yet they were not afraid nor rent their garments—neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words. 25 Nevertheless, Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll, but he would not hear them. 26 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.

27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, 28 "Take for yourself again another scroll and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah has burned. 29 And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, 'Thus says the LORD: "You have burned this scroll, saying, 'Why have you written therein, saying, "The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and cause man and beast to cease from there"?'" 30 Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: "He shall have no one to sit upon the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost. 31 And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity, and I will bring upon them, upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they did not listen."'"

32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And again there were added to them many words like these.

He is taken for a fugitive, beaten, and put in prison, 11-15. He assures Zedekiah of the captivity, 16, 17. Entreating for his liberty, he obtains some favor, 18-21._

1 And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. 2 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.

3 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, "Pray now to the LORD our God for us." 4 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people, for they had not put him into prison. 5 Then Pharaoh's army had come from Egypt. And when the Chaldeans who besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.

6 Then the word of the LORD came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 7 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: 'Thus you shall say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me: "Behold, Pharaoh's army, which has come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land. 8 And the Chaldeans shall come back, fight against this city, take it, and burn it with fire."' 9 Thus says the LORD: 'Do not deceive yourselves, saying, "The Chaldeans will surely depart from us," for they will not depart. 10 For though you had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained only wounded men among them, yet they would each rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.'"

11 And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, 12 Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to separate himself from there in the midst of the people. 13 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You are falling away to the Chaldeans." 14 Then Jeremiah said, "It is false. I do not fall away to the Chaldeans." But he did not listen to him. So Irijah took Jeremiah and brought him to the princes. 15 Therefore, the princes were angry with Jeremiah and beat him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for they had made that the prison. 16 So Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days.

17 Then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out. And the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, "Is there any word from the LORD?" And Jeremiah said, "There is." He said, "You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon." 18 Moreover, Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, "In what have I offended against you, against your servants, or against this people that you have put me in prison? 19 Where are your prophets now who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon shall not come against you nor against this land'? 20 Now therefore, hear, I pray you, O my lord the king. Let my supplication, I pray you, be accepted before you, that you do not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there." 21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him a piece of bread daily out of the baker's street until all the bread in the city was consumed. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

1 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying, 2 "Thus says the LORD: 'He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live, for he shall have his life for plunder and shall live.' 3 Thus says the LORD: 'This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.'" 4 Therefore, the princes said to the king, "We implore you, let this man be put to death, for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words to them. For this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but the hurt." 5 Then Zedekiah the king said, "Behold, he is in your hand, for the king is not he who can do anything against you." 6 Then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech that was in the court of the prison. And they let Jeremiah down with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire. So Jeremiah sunk in the mire. 7 Now when Ebed-melech the Cushite, one of the eunuchs who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin), 8 Ebed-melech went out of the king's house and spoke to the king, saying, 9 "My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. And he is likely to die by hunger in the place where he is, for there is no more bread in the city." 10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, "Take from here thirty men with you and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies." 11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury, took from there old cast cloths and old decayed rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. 12 And Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, "Now put these old cast cloths and decayed rags under your armpits under the cords." And Jeremiah did so. 13 So they drew Jeremiah up with cords and took him out of the dungeon. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

14 Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD. And the king said to Jeremiah, "I will ask you a thing. Hide nothing from me." 15 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me." 16 So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, "As the LORD lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life."

17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: 'If you will assuredly go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then your soul shall live and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you shall live, along with your house. 18 But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.'" 19 And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Jews who have fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock me." 20 But Jeremiah said, "They shall not deliver you. Obey, I implore you, the voice of the LORD, which I speak to you, so that it may be well with you, and that your soul may live. 21 But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD has revealed to me: 22 'And behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say,

23 'So they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. And you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon, and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.'"

24 Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die. 25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, 'Declare to us now what you have said to the king, do not hide it from us and we will not put you to death, and also what the king said to you,' 26 Then you shall say to them, 'I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house to die there.'" 27 Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him, for the matter was not perceived. 28 So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken, and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.

1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and they besieged it. 2 And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up. 3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, and Rab-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon. 4 And it came to pass, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls, and he went out the way of the plain. 5 But the Chaldeans' army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him. 6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also slew all the nobles of Judah. 7 Moreover, he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with chains to carry him to Babylon. 8 And the Chaldeans burned the king's house and the houses of the people with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 9 Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people who remained in the city and those who fell away, who fell to him, with the rest of the people who remained. 10 But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the people who had nothing in the land of Judah and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.

11 Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying, 12 "Take him, look well to him, and do him no harm, but do to him even as he says to you." 13 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the king of Babylon's princes, 14 They even sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, so that he should carry him home. So he dwelt among the people.

15 Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he was confined in the court of the prison, saying, 16 "Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good, and they shall be accomplished in that day before you. 17 But I will deliver you in that day," says the LORD, "and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. 18 For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be as plunder to you because you have put your trust in me," says the LORD.'"

1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all who were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon. 2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, "The LORD your God has pronounced this evil upon this place. 3 Now the LORD has brought it and done according as he has said. Because you have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come upon you. 4 And now, behold, I release you this day from the chains which were upon your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well to you. But if it seems ill to you to come with me into Babylon, forbear. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right for you to go, go there." 5 Now while he had not yet gone back, he said, "Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people, or go wherever it seems convenient for you to go." So the captain of the guard gave him provisions and a reward and let him go. 6 Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land.

7 Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields—they and their men—heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men, women, children, and those of the poorest of the land who were not carried away captive to Babylon, 8 They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite—they and their men. 9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, "Do not fear to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. 10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans who will come to us. But you, gather wine, summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels and dwell in your cities that you have taken." 11 Likewise, when all the Jews who were in Moab, among the Ammonites, in Edom, and who were in all the countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, 12 Even all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in abundance.

13 Moreover, Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, 14 And said to him, "Do you certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay you?" But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them. 15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, "Let me go, I pray you, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it. Why should he slay you so that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered and the remnant of Judah perish?" 16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, "You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely of Ishmael."

_Ishmael, treacherously killing Gedaliah and others, purposes with the remnant to flee to the Ammonites, 1-10. Johanan recovers the captives and is minded to flee into Egypt, 11-18._

1 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah. And there they ate bread together in Mizpah. 2 Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. 3 Ishmael also slew all the Jews who were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean men of war who were found there.

4 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, 5 That there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes rent and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD. 6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went. And it came to pass, as he met them, he said to them, "Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam." 7 And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit—he and the men who were with him. 8 But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael, "Do not slay us, for we have treasures in the field of wheat, of barley, of oil, and of honey." So he forbore and did not slay them among their brothers.

9 Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were slain. 10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the remnant of the people who were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the Ammonites.

11 But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 12 They took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. 13 Now it came to pass, that when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him, they were glad. 14 So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and returned and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. 15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites. 16 Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people from Mizpeh whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon. 17 And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt 18 Because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.

1 Then all the captains of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest came near 2 And said to Jeremiah the prophet, "We implore you, let our supplication be accepted before you, and pray for us to the LORD your God, even for all this remnant (for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes behold us), 3 So that the LORD your God may show us the way in which we may walk and the thing that we may do." 4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your words. And it shall come to pass, that whatever thing the LORD answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you." 5 Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not do according to all things for which the LORD your God sends you to us. 6 Whether it be good or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send you, so that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God."

7 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah. 8 Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, 9 And said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him: 10 'If you will still abide in this land, then I will build you and not pull you down, and I will plant you and not pluck you up, for I repent of the evil that I have done to you. 11 Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Do not be afraid of him,' says the LORD, 'for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand. 12 And I will show mercies to you, so that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land. 13 But if you say, "We will not dwell in this land," neither obey the voice of the LORD your God, 14 Saying, "No, but we will go into the land of Egypt where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor hunger for bread. And there we will dwell," 15 Then therefore, hear the word of the LORD, you remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "If you wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt and go to sojourn there, 16 Then it shall come to pass, that the sword which you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which you were afraid shall follow close after you there in Egypt. And there you shall die. 17 Thus it shall be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there. They shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. And none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them."'

18 "For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'As my anger and my fury has been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my fury shall be poured forth upon you when you enter into Egypt. And you shall be an object of horror, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach, and you shall see this place no more.' 19 The LORD has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, 'Do not go into Egypt.' Know certainly that I have admonished you this day. 20 For you dissembled in your hearts when you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, 'Pray for us to the LORD our God, and according to all that the LORD our God says, declare it to us, and we will do it.' 21 And now I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God nor anything for which he has sent me to you. 22 Now therefore, know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go and to sojourn."

The LORD our God has not sent you to say, 'Do not go into Egypt to sojourn there.' 3 But Baruch the son of Neriah entices you against us to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans so that they may put us to death and carry us away as captives into Babylon." 4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces, and all the people did not obey the voice of the LORD to dwell in the land of Judah. 5 But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all nations where they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah— 6 Even men, women, children, the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. 7 So they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the LORD.

1 A word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwell in the land of Egypt, who dwell at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'You have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah, and behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwells in them 3 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods, whom they did not know—neither they, you, nor your fathers. 4 Yet I sent all my servants the prophets to you, rising early and sending them, saying, "Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate." 5 But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their wickedness and burn no incense to other gods. 6 Therefore, my fury and my anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day. 7 And now, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: "Why do you commit this great evil against your souls, to cut off from yourselves man and woman, child and infant, out of Judah to leave yourselves no one to remain, 8 In that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to dwell, so that you may cut yourselves off and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 9 Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 10 They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, which I set before you and before your fathers."'

11 "Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I will set my face against you for evil and to cut off all Judah. 12 And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of Egypt. They shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine. They shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine. And they shall be an object of horror, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach. 13 For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, 14 So that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there. For none shall return but those who escape.'"

15 Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods and all the women who stood by, a great multitude, even all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, 16 "As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you. 17 But we will certainly do whatever thing proceeds from our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done—we, our fathers, our kings, and our princes—in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of provisions and were well and saw no evil. 18 But since we ceased to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink-offerings to her, we have lacked all things and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. 19 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink-offerings to her, did we make for her cakes to worship her and pour out drink-offerings to her without our men?"

20 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, to the women, and to all the people who had given him that answer, saying, 21 "The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land—did the LORD not remember them, and did it not come into his mind? 22 So the LORD could no longer bear because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which you have committed; therefore, your land is a desolation, an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. 23 Because you have burned incense and because you have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies, therefore this evil has happened to you, as at this day."

24 Moreover, Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt. 25 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, 'You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hand, saying, "We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink-offerings to her." You will surely accomplish your vows and surely perform your vows.' 26 Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: 'Behold, I have sworn by my great name,' says the LORD, 'that my name shall no longer be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, "The Lord GOD lives." 27 Behold, I will watch over them for evil and not for good. And all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine until there is an end of them. 28 Yet a small number who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there shall know whose words shall stand—mine, or theirs. 29 And this shall be a sign to you,' says the LORD, 'that I will punish you in this place so that you may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil.' 30 Thus says the LORD: 'Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and sought his life.'"

so that he may avenge himself of his adversaries. [.linebr]#/# +
And the sword shall devour and shall be satiated [.linebr]#/# +

O virgin, the daughter of Egypt. [.linebr]#/# +
In vain you shall use many medicines, [.linebr]#/# +

For the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, [.linebr]#/# +

1 [_Against Moab._] Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|
|"Woe to Nebo! For it is laid waste. [.linebr]#/# +
Kiriathaim is confounded and taken. [.linebr]#/# +
Misgab is confounded and dismayed.

|
|2 There shall be no more praise of Moab. [.linebr]#/# +
In Heshbon they have devised evil against it. [.linebr]#/# +
'Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation.' [.linebr]#/# +
Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen. [.linebr]#/# +
The sword shall pursue you.

|
|3 A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, [.linebr]#/# +
'Devastation and great destruction.'

|
|4 Moab is destroyed. [.linebr]#/# +
Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.

|
|5 For in the ascent of Luhith [.linebr]#/# +
continual weeping shall go up. [.linebr]#/# +
For in the descent of Horonaim [.linebr]#/# +
the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.

|
|6 Flee, save your lives, [.linebr]#/# +
and be like the heath in the wilderness.

|
|7 For because you have trusted [.linebr]#/# +
in your works and in your treasures, [.linebr]#/# +
you also shall be taken. [.linebr]#/# +
And Chemosh shall go forth into captivity [.linebr]#/# +
with his priests and his princes together.

|
|8 And the destroyer shall come upon every city, [.linebr]#/# +
and no city shall escape. [.linebr]#/# +
The valley shall also perish, [.linebr]#/# +
and the plain shall be destroyed, [.linebr]#/# +
as the LORD has spoken.

|
|9 Give wings to Moab [.linebr]#/# +
so that it may flee and get away, [.linebr]#/# +
for its cities shall be desolate [.linebr]#/# +
without any to dwell in them.

|
|10 Cursed is he who does the work of the LORD deceitfully, [.linebr]#/# +
and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.

|
|11 Moab has been at ease from his youth, [.linebr]#/# +
and he has settled on his dregs [.linebr]#/# +
and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, [.linebr]#/# +
neither has he gone into captivity. [.linebr]#/# +
Therefore, his taste remained in him, [.linebr]#/# +
and his scent is not changed.

|
|12 "Therefore, behold, the days come," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"that I will send to him wanderers [.linebr]#/# +
who shall cause him to wander, [.linebr]#/# +
and shall empty his vessels [.linebr]#/# +
and break their bottles.

|
|13 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, [.linebr]#/# +
as the house of Israel was ashamed [.linebr]#/# +
of Beth-el their confidence.

|
|14 "How do you say, [.linebr]#/# +
'We are mighty and strong men for the war'?

|
|15 Moab is laid waste and gone up out of her cities, [.linebr]#/# +
and his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter," [.linebr]#/# +
says the King, [.linebr]#/# +
whose name is the LORD of hosts.

|
|16 "The calamity of Moab is near to come, [.linebr]#/# +
and his affliction hastens fast.

|
|17 All you who are around him, bemoan him, [.linebr]#/# +
and all you who know his name. [.linebr]#/# +
Say, 'How the strong staff is broken, [.linebr]#/# +

|
|18 You daughter who inhabits Dibon, [.linebr]#/# +
come down from your glory and sit in thirst, [.linebr]#/# +
for the destroyer of Moab shall come upon you [.linebr]#/# +

|19 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch. [.linebr]#/# +
Ask him who flees and her who escapes, [.linebr]#/# +

|

for it is broken down. [.linebr]#/# +
Howl and cry. [.linebr]#/# +
Tell it in Arnon [.linebr]#/# +

21 "And judgment has come upon the plain country: upon Holon, upon Jahazah, upon Mephaath, 22 Upon Dibon, upon Nebo, upon Beth-diblathaim, 23 Upon Kiriathaim, upon Beth-gamul, upon Beth-meon, 24 Upon Kerioth, upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. 25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken," says the LORD. 26 "Make him drunken, for he magnified himself against the LORD. Moab shall also wallow in his vomit and shall also be in derision. 27 For was Israel not a derision to you? Was he found among thieves? For since you have spoken of him, you have leaped for joy.

in the sides of the hole's mouth.

|
|29 We have heard the pride of Moab [.linebr]#/# +
(he is exceedingly proud), [.linebr]#/# +
his loftiness, his arrogance, his pride, [.linebr]#/# +
and the haughtiness of his heart.

|
|30 I know his wrath," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"that it is nothing. [.linebr]#/# +
His boastings have wrought nothing.

|
|31 Therefore, I will howl for Moab, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will cry out for all Moab. [.linebr]#/# +
My heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.

|32 O vine of Sibmah, [.linebr]#/# +
I will weep for you with the weeping of Jazer. [.linebr]#/# +
Your plants have gone over the sea. [.linebr]#/# +
They reach even to the sea of Jazer. [.linebr]#/# +
The destroyer has fallen [.linebr]#/# +
upon your summer fruits and upon your vintage.

|33 And joy and gladness is taken [.linebr]#/# +
from the plentiful field and from the land of Moab, [.linebr]#/# +
and I have caused wine to fail from the wine-presses. [.linebr]#/# +
No one shall tread with shouting. [.linebr]#/# +
Their shouting shall be no shouting.

34 "From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, and even to Jahaz, they have uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, as a heifer of three years old. For the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate. 35 Moreover, I will cause to cease in Moab," says the LORD, "him who offers in the high places and him who burns incense to his gods.

36 "Therefore, my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres because the riches that he has gotten have perished. 37 For every head shall be bald and every beard clipped. Upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins is sackcloth. 38 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the house-tops of Moab and in its streets, for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which there is no pleasure," says the LORD. 39 "They shall howl, saying, 'How it is broken down! How Moab has turned the back with shame!' So Moab shall be a derision and a dismaying to all who are around him."

"Behold, he shall fly like an eagle [.linebr]#/# +

and the strongholds are surprised, [.linebr]#/# +
and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day [.linebr]#/# +
shall be like the heart of a woman in her pangs.

|
|42 And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people [.linebr]#/# +
because he has magnified himself against the LORD.

|
|43 Fear, the pit, and the snare [.linebr]#/# +
shall be upon you, O inhabitant of Moab," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|44 "He who flees from the fear [.linebr]#/# +
shall fall into the pit. [.linebr]#/# +
And he who gets out of the pit [.linebr]#/# +
shall be taken in the snare. [.linebr]#/# +
For I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, [.linebr]#/# +
the year of their visitation," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

because of the force. [.linebr]#/# +
But a fire shall come out of Heshbon, [.linebr]#/# +
and a flame from the midst of Sihon, [.linebr]#/# +
and shall devour the corner of Moab [.linebr]#/# +
and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.

The people of Chemosh perish, [.linebr]#/# +
for your sons are taken away captive, [.linebr]#/# +
and your daughters into captivity.

|
|"Does Israel have no sons? [.linebr]#/# +
Does he have no heir? [.linebr]#/# +
Why then does their king inherit Gad, [.linebr]#/# +
and his people dwell in his cities?

Then Israel shall be heir to those who were his heirs," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

Cry, you daughters of Rabbah. [.linebr]#/# +
Gird yourselves with sackcloth. [.linebr]#/# +
Lament, and run to and fro by the hedges. [.linebr]#/# +

|4 Why do you glory in the valleys, [.linebr]#/# +
your flowing valley, O backsliding daughter, [.linebr]#/# +
who trusted in her treasures, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
'Who shall come to me?'

|
|5 Behold, I will bring a fear upon you," [.linebr]#/# +
says the Lord GOD of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +
"from all those who are around you. [.linebr]#/# +
And you shall each be driven out headlong. [.linebr]#/# +
And no one shall gather up him who wanders.

|
|6 And afterward, I will bring back the captivity [.linebr]#/# +

says the LORD.

7 [_Concerning Edom._] Thus says the LORD of hosts:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"Is wisdom no longer in Teman? [.linebr]#/# +
Has counsel perished from the prudent? [.linebr]#/# +
Has their wisdom vanished?

|
|8 Flee, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan, [.linebr]#/# +
for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, [.linebr]#/# +

|
|9 If grape-gatherers come to you, [.linebr]#/# +
would they not leave some gleaning grapes? [.linebr]#/# +
If thieves by night, [.linebr]#/# +
they will destroy until they have enough.

|
|10 But I have made Esau bare, [.linebr]#/# +
I have uncovered his secret places, [.linebr]#/# +
and he shall not be able to hide himself. [.linebr]#/# +
His offspring is laid waste, [.linebr]#/# +
along with his brothers and his neighbors, [.linebr]#/# +
and he is no more.

|
|11 Leave your fatherless children. [.linebr]#/# +
I will preserve them alive. [.linebr]#/# +
And let your widows trust in me."
|===

12 For thus says the LORD: "Behold, those whose judgment was not to drink the cup have assuredly drank. And are you he who shall altogether go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink it. 13 For I have sworn by myself," says the LORD, "that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse, and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes."

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|14 I have heard a rumor from the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and an ambassador is sent to the heathen, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
"Assemble, and come against her [.linebr]#/# +
and rise up to the battle,

|
|15 For behold, I will make you small among the heathen [.linebr]#/# +
and despised among men.

|
|16 Your terribleness has deceived you, [.linebr]#/# +
and the pride of your heart, [.linebr]#/# +
O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, [.linebr]#/# +
who hold the height of the hill. [.linebr]#/# +
Though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, [.linebr]#/# +
I will bring you down from there," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

17 "Also, Edom shall be a desolation. Everyone who goes by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all her plagues. 18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring cities," says the LORD, "no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it. 19 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan against the habitation of the strong, but I will suddenly make him run away from her. And who is a chosen man that I may appoint over her? For who is like me? And who will appoint me the time? And who is that shepherd who will stand before me?"

20 Therefore, hear the counsel of the LORD that he has taken against Edom, and also his purposes that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman. Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out. Surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them. 21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall. At the cry its noise was heard in the Red Sea. 22 Behold, he shall come up and fly like the eagle and spread his wings over Bozrah. And at that day the heart of the mighty men of Edom shall be like the heart of a woman in her pangs.

|9 For behold, I will raise and cause to come against Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
an assembly of great nations from the north country. [.linebr]#/# +
And they shall set themselves in array against her. [.linebr]#/# +
From there she shall be taken. [.linebr]#/# +
Their arrows shall be like those of an expert warrior. [.linebr]#/# +
None shall return in vain.

|
|10 And Chaldea shall be plundered. [.linebr]#/# +
All who plunder her shall be satisfied," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|11 "Because you were glad, because you rejoiced, [.linebr]#/# +
O destroyers of my heritage, [.linebr]#/# +
because you have grown fat like a heifer in the grass [.linebr]#/# +
and bellow like bulls,

|
|12 Your mother shall be greatly confounded. [.linebr]#/# +
She who bore you shall be ashamed. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, the hindmost of the nations [.linebr]#/# +
shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.

|
|13 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, [.linebr]#/# +
but it shall be wholly desolate. [.linebr]#/# +
Everyone who goes by Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
shall be astonished and hiss at all her plagues.

|
|14 Put yourselves in array against Babylon on every side. [.linebr]#/# +
All you who bend the bow, [.linebr]#/# +
shoot at her, spare no arrows, [.linebr]#/# +
for she has sinned against the LORD.

|
|15 Shout against her on every side. [.linebr]#/# +
She has given her hand. [.linebr]#/# +
Her foundations have fallen. [.linebr]#/# +
Her walls are thrown down. [.linebr]#/# +
Since it is the vengeance of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
take vengeance upon her. [.linebr]#/# +
As she has done, do to her.

|
|16 Cut off the sower from Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest. [.linebr]#/# +
For fear of the oppressing sword, [.linebr]#/# +
they shall each turn to his people [.linebr]#/# +
and shall each flee to his own land.

|
|17 "Israel is a scattered sheep. [.linebr]#/# +
The lions have driven him away. [.linebr]#/# +
First the king of Assyria has devoured him, [.linebr]#/# +
and last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
has broken his bones.

18 Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|'Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, [.linebr]#/# +
as I have punished the king of Assyria.

|
|19 And I will bring Israel back to his habitation, [.linebr]#/# +
and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, [.linebr]#/# +
and his soul shall be satisfied [.linebr]#/# +
upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.

|
|20 In those days and in that time,' [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
'the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, [.linebr]#/# +
and there shall be none, [.linebr]#/# +
and the sins of Judah, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall not be found, [.linebr]#/# +
for I will pardon those whom I reserve.'

|
|21 "Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, [.linebr]#/# +
and against the inhabitants of Pekod. [.linebr]#/# +
Waste and utterly destroy after them," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"and do according to all that I have commanded you.

|
|22 A sound of battle is in the land, [.linebr]#/# +
and of great destruction.

|
|23 How the hammer of the whole earth [.linebr]#/# +
is cut apart and broken! [.linebr]#/# +
How Babylon has become [.linebr]#/# +
a desolation among the nations!

|
|24 I have laid a snare for you, [.linebr]#/# +
and you are also taken, O Babylon, [.linebr]#/# +
and you were not aware. [.linebr]#/# +
You are found and also caught [.linebr]#/# +
because you have striven against the LORD."

|
|25 The LORD has opened his armory [.linebr]#/# +
and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation, [.linebr]#/# +
for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts [.linebr]#/# +
in the land of the Chaldeans.

|
|26 Come against her from the utmost border. [.linebr]#/# +
Open her store-houses. [.linebr]#/# +
Cast her up like heaps and destroy her utterly. [.linebr]#/# +
Let nothing of her be left.

|
|27 Slay all her bulls. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them go down to the slaughter. [.linebr]#/# +
Woe to them! For their day has come, [.linebr]#/# +
the time of their visitation.

|
|28 The voice of those who flee and escape from the land of Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
declares in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, [.linebr]#/# +
the vengeance of his temple.

|
|29 "Call together the archers against Babylon. [.linebr]#/# +
All you who bend the bow, [.linebr]#/# +
encamp against it on every side. [.linebr]#/# +
Let none thereof escape. [.linebr]#/# +
Recompense her according to her work. [.linebr]#/# +
According to all that she has done, do to her, [.linebr]#/# +
for she has been proud against the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
against the Holy One of Israel.

|
|30 Therefore, her young men shall fall in the streets [.linebr]#/# +
and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|31 "Behold, I am against you, O most proud," [.linebr]#/# +
says the Lord GOD of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +
"for your day has come, [.linebr]#/# +
the time that I will visit you.

|
|32 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, [.linebr]#/# +
and no one shall raise him up. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will kindle a fire in his cities, [.linebr]#/# +
and it shall devour all around him."
|===

33 Thus says the LORD of hosts:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"The children of Israel and the children of Judah [.linebr]#/# +
were oppressed together. [.linebr]#/# +
And all who took them captives held them fast. [.linebr]#/# +
They refused to let them go.

|
|34 Their Redeemer is strong. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD of hosts is his name. [.linebr]#/# +
He will thoroughly plead their cause [.linebr]#/# +
so that he may give rest to the land [.linebr]#/# +
and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.

|
|35 A sword is upon the Chaldeans," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, [.linebr]#/# +
upon her princes, and upon her wise men.

|
|36 A sword is upon the liars, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall be foolish. [.linebr]#/# +
A sword is upon her mighty men, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall be dismayed.

|
|37 A sword is upon their horses, upon their chariots, [.linebr]#/# +
and upon all the mingled people [.linebr]#/# +
who are in the midst of her, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall become like women. [.linebr]#/# +
A sword is upon her treasures, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall be robbed.

|
|38 A drought is upon her waters, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall be dried up. [.linebr]#/# +
For it is the land of engraved images, [.linebr]#/# +
and they are mad upon their idols.

|
|39 Therefore, the wild beasts of the desert and the wolves shall dwell there, [.linebr]#/# +
and the owls shall dwell therein. [.linebr]#/# +
And it shall be no longer inhabited forever, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.

|
|40 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah [.linebr]#/# +
and the neighboring cities," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"so shall no man abide there, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall any son of man dwell therein.

|
|41 Behold, a people shall come from the north, [.linebr]#/# +
and a great nation, and many kings [.linebr]#/# +
shall be raised up from the borders of the earth.

|
|42 They shall hold the bow and the lance. [.linebr]#/# +
They are cruel and will not show mercy. [.linebr]#/# +
Their voice shall roar like the sea [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall ride upon horses, [.linebr]#/# +
each put in array, like a man to the battle, [.linebr]#/# +
against you, O daughter of Babylon.

|
|43 The king of Babylon has heard their report [.linebr]#/# +
and his hands became feeble. [.linebr]#/# +
Anguish took hold of him, [.linebr]#/# +
and pangs as of a woman in travail.

|
|44 "Behold, he shall come up like a lion [.linebr]#/# +
from the swelling of the Jordan [.linebr]#/# +
to the habitation of the strong, [.linebr]#/# +
but I will make them suddenly run away from her. [.linebr]#/# +
And who is a chosen man whom I may appoint over her? [.linebr]#/# +
For who is like me? [.linebr]#/# +
And who will appoint me the time? [.linebr]#/# +
And who is that shepherd who will stand before me?"

|
|45 Therefore, hear the counsel of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
that he has taken against Babylon, [.linebr]#/# +
and also his purposes that he has purposed [.linebr]#/# +
against the land of the Chaldeans. [.linebr]#/# +
Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out. [.linebr]#/# +
Surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.

|
|46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, [.linebr]#/# +
and the cry is heard among the nations.

[.outline.text-center]
_The severe judgment of God against Babylon in revenge of Israel, 1-58. Jeremiah delivers the book of this prophecy to Seraiah, to be cast into the Euphrates, in token of the perpetual sinking of Babylon, 59-64._

1 Thus says the LORD:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"Behold, I will raise up a destroying wind against Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
and against those who dwell in the midst of those who rise against me,

|
|2 And I will send fanners to Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
who shall fan her [.linebr]#/# +
and shall empty her land. [.linebr]#/# +
For in the day of trouble [.linebr]#/# +
they shall be against her on all sides.

|
|3 Against him who bends, let the archer bend his bow, [.linebr]#/# +
and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail. [.linebr]#/# +
And do not spare her young men. [.linebr]#/# +
Utterly destroy all her host.

|
|4 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who are thrust through in her streets."

|
|5 For Israel has not been forsaken [.linebr]#/# +
nor Judah by his God, by the LORD of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +
though their land was filled with sin [.linebr]#/# +
against the Holy One of Israel.

|
|6 Flee from the midst of Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
and deliver every man his soul. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not be cut off in her iniquity, [.linebr]#/# +
for this is the time of the LORD'S vengeance. [.linebr]#/# +
He will render to her a recompense.

|
|7 Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORD'S hand, [.linebr]#/# +
who made all the earth drunken. [.linebr]#/# +
The nations have drank her wine; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, the nations are mad.

|
|8 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed. [.linebr]#/# +
Howl for her. [.linebr]#/# +
Take balm for her pain. [.linebr]#/# +
It may be that she may be healed.

|
|9 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed. [.linebr]#/# +
Forsake her, and let us each go into his own country, [.linebr]#/# +
for her judgment reaches to heaven [.linebr]#/# +
and is lifted even to the skies.

|
|10 The LORD has brought forth our righteousness. [.linebr]#/# +
Come, and let us declare in Zion [.linebr]#/# +
the work of the LORD our God.

|
|11 Make the arrows bright. [.linebr]#/# +
Gather the shields. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, [.linebr]#/# +
for his purpose is against Babylon to destroy it, [.linebr]#/# +
because it is the vengeance of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
the vengeance of his temple.

|
|12 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon. [.linebr]#/# +
Make the watch strong. [.linebr]#/# +
Set up the watchmen. [.linebr]#/# +
Prepare the ambushes. [.linebr]#/# +
For the LORD has both devised and done [.linebr]#/# +
that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.

|
|13 O you who dwell upon many waters, [.linebr]#/# +
abundant in treasures, [.linebr]#/# +
your end has come, [.linebr]#/# +
and the measure of your covetousness.
|===

14 The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself, saying,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"Surely I will fill you with men, [.linebr]#/# +
as with licking-locusts, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall raise a shout against you."

|
|15 He has made the earth by his power, [.linebr]#/# +
he has established the world by his wisdom [.linebr]#/# +
and has stretched out the heaven by his understanding.

|
|16 When he utters his voice, [.linebr]#/# +
there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, [.linebr]#/# +
and he causes the vapors to ascend [.linebr]#/# +
from the ends of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
He makes lightnings with rain [.linebr]#/# +
and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.

|
|17 Every man is brutish by his knowledge. [.linebr]#/# +
Every founder is confounded by the engraved image, [.linebr]#/# +
for his molten image is falsehood, [.linebr]#/# +
and there is no breath in them.

|
|18 They are vanity, the work of errors. [.linebr]#/# +
In the time of their visitation they shall perish.

|
|19 The portion of Jacob is not like them, [.linebr]#/# +
for he is the former of all things, [.linebr]#/# +
and Israel is the rod of his inheritance. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD of hosts is his name.

|
|20 "You are my battle-ax and weapons of war. [.linebr]#/# +
For with you I will break in pieces the nations, [.linebr]#/# +
with you I will destroy kingdoms,

|
|21 With you I will break in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
the horse and his rider, [.linebr]#/# +
with you I will break in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
the chariot and its rider,

|
|22 With you I will break in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
man and woman, [.linebr]#/# +
with you I will break in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
old and young, [.linebr]#/# +
with you I will break in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
the young man and the virgin,

|
|23 With you I will break in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
the shepherd and his flock, [.linebr]#/# +
with you I will break in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
the farmer and his yoke of oxen, [.linebr]#/# +
and with you I will break in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
captains and rulers.

|
|24 And I will render to Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea [.linebr]#/# +
all their evil that they have done [.linebr]#/# +
in Zion in your sight," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|25 "Behold, I am against you, [.linebr]#/# +
O destroying mountain," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"which destroys all the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will stretch out my hand upon you, [.linebr]#/# +
roll you down from the rocks, [.linebr]#/# +
and make you a burnt mountain.

|
|26 And they shall not take from you a stone for a corner, [.linebr]#/# +
nor a stone for foundations, [.linebr]#/# +
but you shall be desolate forever," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|27 Set up a standard in the land. [.linebr]#/# +
Blow the trumpet among the nations. [.linebr]#/# +
Prepare the nations against her. [.linebr]#/# +
Call together against her [.linebr]#/# +
the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz. [.linebr]#/# +
Appoint a captain against her. [.linebr]#/# +
Cause the horses to come up [.linebr]#/# +
as the rough licking-locusts.

|
|28 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of Media, [.linebr]#/# +
her captains, and all her rulers, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the land of his dominion.

|
|29 And the land shall tremble and sorrow, [.linebr]#/# +
for every purpose of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
shall be performed against Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
to make the land of Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
a desolation without an inhabitant.

|
|30 The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight. [.linebr]#/# +
They have remained in their holds. [.linebr]#/# +
Their might has failed. [.linebr]#/# +
They became like women. [.linebr]#/# +
They have burned her dwelling-places. [.linebr]#/# +
Her bars are broken.

|
|31 One post shall run to meet another [.linebr]#/# +
and one messenger to meet another [.linebr]#/# +
to show the king of Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
that his city is taken at one end,

|
|32 And that the passages are stopped, [.linebr]#/# +
the reeds they have burned with fire, [.linebr]#/# +
and the men of war are terrified.
|===

33 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor [.linebr]#/# +
at the time when it is trodden. [.linebr]#/# +
Yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come."

|
|34 "Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me. [.linebr]#/# +
He has crushed me. [.linebr]#/# +
He has made me an empty vessel. [.linebr]#/# +
He has swallowed me up like a sea-monster. [.linebr]#/# +
He has filled his belly with my delicacies. [.linebr]#/# +
He has cast me out.

|
|35 May the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon," [.linebr]#/# +
the inhabitant of Zion shall say. [.linebr]#/# +
"May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea," [.linebr]#/# +
Jerusalem shall say.
|===

36 Therefore, thus says the LORD:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"Behold, I will plead your cause [.linebr]#/# +
and take vengeance for you, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will dry up her sea [.linebr]#/# +
and make her springs dry.

|
|37 And Babylon shall become heaps, [.linebr]#/# +
a dwelling-place for jackals, [.linebr]#/# +
an astonishment, and a hissing, [.linebr]#/# +
without an inhabitant.

|
|38 They shall roar together like lions. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall yell like lions' whelps.

|
|39 In their heat I will make their feasts, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will make them drunken [.linebr]#/# +
so that they may rejoice [.linebr]#/# +
and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|40 "I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, [.linebr]#/# +
like rams with male goats.

|
|41 How Sheshach is taken! [.linebr]#/# +
And how the praise of the whole earth is surprised! [.linebr]#/# +
How Babylon has become an astonishment among the nations!

|
|42 The sea has come up upon Babylon. [.linebr]#/# +
She is covered with the multitude of its waves.

|
|43 Her cities are a desolation, [.linebr]#/# +
a dry land, and a wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
a land in which no man dwells, [.linebr]#/# +
neither does any son of man pass by it.

|
|44 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will bring forth out of his mouth [.linebr]#/# +
that which he has swallowed. [.linebr]#/# +
And the nations shall not flow together anymore to him. [.linebr]#/# +
Even the wall of Babylon shall fall.

|
|45 My people, depart from the midst of her, [.linebr]#/# +
and each of you deliver his soul [.linebr]#/# +
from the fierce anger of the LORD.

|
|46 And lest your heart should faint and you should fear [.linebr]#/# +
because of the rumor that shall be heard in the land, [.linebr]#/# +
a rumor shall both come one year, [.linebr]#/# +
and after that in another year a rumor shall come, [.linebr]#/# +
of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler.

|
|47 Therefore, behold, the days come [.linebr]#/# +
that I will do judgment upon the engraved images of Babylon. [.linebr]#/# +
And her whole land shall be confounded, [.linebr]#/# +
and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.

|
|48 Then the heaven and the earth and all that is in them [.linebr]#/# +
shall sing for Babylon, [.linebr]#/# +
for the destroyers shall come to her [.linebr]#/# +
from the north," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|49 As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, [.linebr]#/# +
so at Babylon the slain of all the earth shall fall.

|
|50 You who have escaped the sword, [.linebr]#/# +
go away, do not stand still. [.linebr]#/# +
Remember the LORD afar off [.linebr]#/# +
and let Jerusalem come into your mind.

|
|51 We are confounded because we have heard reproach. [.linebr]#/# +
Shame has covered our faces, [.linebr]#/# +
for strangers have come [.linebr]#/# +
into the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house.

|
|52 "Therefore, behold, the days come," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"that I will do judgment upon her engraved images. [.linebr]#/# +
And through all her land the wounded shall groan.

|
|53 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, [.linebr]#/# +
and though she should fortify the height of her strength, [.linebr]#/# +
yet from me destroyers shall come to her," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

|
|54 A sound of a cry comes from Babylon, [.linebr]#/# +
and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans,

|
|55 Because the LORD has laid waste Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
and destroyed out of her the great voice. [.linebr]#/# +
When her waves roar like great waters, [.linebr]#/# +
a noise of their voice is uttered.

|
|56 For the destroyer has come upon her, [.linebr]#/# +
even upon Babylon. [.linebr]#/# +
Her mighty men are taken, [.linebr]#/# +
and every one of their bows is broken, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD God of recompenses shall surely requite.

|
|57 "And I will make drunk her princes, her wise men, [.linebr]#/# +
her captains, her rulers, and her mighty men. [.linebr]#/# +
And they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake," [.linebr]#/# +
says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.

58 Thus says the LORD of hosts:

The people shall labor in vain, [.linebr]#/# +

59 This is the word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince. 60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon. 61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "When you come to Babylon and see, and read all these words, 62 You shall say, 'O LORD, you have spoken against this place to cut it off so that no one shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate forever.' 63 And it shall be when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates, 64 And you shall say, 'Thus Babylon shall sink and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her, and they shall be weary.'"

=== Chapter 52

[.outline.text-center]
_Zedekiah rebels, 1-3. Jerusalem is besieged and taken, 4-7. Zedekiah's sons killed, and his own eyes put out, 8-11. Nebuzar-adan burns and plunders the city, 12-23. He carries away the captives, 24-27. The number of Jews carried captive, 28-30. Evil-merodach advances Jehoiachin, 31-34._

1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 2 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. 3 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 4 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came—he and all his army—against Jerusalem. They encamped against it and built forts against it on every side. 5 So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 6 And in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the land. 7 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled and went forth from the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden (now the Chaldeans were by the city on all sides), and they went by the way of the plain. 8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him. 9 Then they took the king and carried him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him. 10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also slew all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah. And the king of Babylon bound him in chains, carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.

12 Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem 13 And burned the house of the LORD and the king's house. All the houses of Jerusalem, even all the houses of the great men, he burned with fire. 14 And all of the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls of Jerusalem on every side. 15 Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poor of the people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. 16 But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land for vine-dressers and for farmers.

17 Also, the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke and carried all their brass to Babylon. 18 And the cauldrons, the shovels, the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away. 19 And the basins, the fire-pans, the bowls, the cauldrons, the candlesticks, the spoons, and the cups—the gold from that which was made of gold, and the silver from that which was made of silver—the captain of the guard took away. 20 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD, the brass of all these vessels was without weight. 21 And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a fillet of twelve cubits encompassed it, and its thickness was four fingers. It was hollow. 22 And a capital of brass was upon it, and the height of one capital was five cubits, with net-work and pomegranates upon the capitals around, all of brass. The second pillar and the pomegranates were like these. 23 And there were ninety-six pomegranates on a side, and all the pomegranates upon the net-work were one hundred on all sides.

24 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door. 25 He also took a eunuch out of the city who had the charge of the men of war, seven men of those who were near the king's person who were found in the city, the principal scribe of the host who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city. 26 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 27 And the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death in Riblah, in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.

28 This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand and twenty-three Jews; 29 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons; 30 In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons. All the persons were four thousand and six hundred.

31 And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison. 32 He spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon. 33 And he changed his prison garments and continually ate bread before him all the days of his life. 34 And for his food there was a continual diet given to him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
