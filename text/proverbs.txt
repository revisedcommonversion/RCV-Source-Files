=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_The use of the proverbs, 1-6. An exhortation to fear God, and believe his word, 7-9; to avoid the enticings of sinners, 10-19. Wisdom bemoans her contempt, 20-23. She threatens her despisers, 24-33._

1 [_The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel._]

2 To know wisdom and instruction, [.linebr]#/# +
to perceive the words of understanding,

3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, [.linebr]#/# +
justice, judgment, and equity,

4 To give subtlety to the simple, [.linebr]#/# +
to the young man knowledge and discretion,

5 A wise man will hear and will increase learning, [.linebr]#/# +
and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels,

6 To understand a proverb and the interpretation, [.linebr]#/# +
the words of the wise and their dark sayings.

7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, [.linebr]#/# +
but fools despise wisdom and instruction.

8 My son, hear the instruction of your father [.linebr]#/# +
and do not forsake the law of your mother,

9 For they shall be an ornament of grace to your head [.linebr]#/# +
and chains around your neck.

10 My son, if sinners entice you, [.linebr]#/# +
do not consent.

11 If they say, "Come with us. Let us lie in wait for blood. [.linebr]#/# +
Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.

12 Let us swallow them up alive like the grave, [.linebr]#/# +
and whole, like those who go down into the pit.

13 We shall find all precious substance. [.linebr]#/# +
We shall fill our houses with plunder.

14 Cast in your lot among us. [.linebr]#/# +
Let us all have one purse"—

15 My son, do not walk in the way with them. [.linebr]#/# +
Refrain your foot from their path,

16 For their feet run to evil [.linebr]#/# +
and make haste to shed blood.

17 Surely in vain the net is spread [.linebr]#/# +
in the sight of any bird.

18 And they lie in wait for their own blood. [.linebr]#/# +
They lurk secretly for their own lives.

19 Thus are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain, [.linebr]#/# +
who takes away the life of its owners.

20 Wisdom cries outside. [.linebr]#/# +
She utters her voice in the streets.

21 She cries in the chief place of concourse, [.linebr]#/# +
in the openings of the gates. [.linebr]#/# +
In the city she utters her words, saying,

22 "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity, [.linebr]#/# +
and the scorners delight in their scorning, [.linebr]#/# +
and fools hate knowledge?

23 Turn at my reproof. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, I will pour out my spirit to you. [.linebr]#/# +
I will make my words known to you.

24 Because I have called and you refused, [.linebr]#/# +
I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded.

25 But you have set at nothing all my counsel [.linebr]#/# +
and rejected my reproof.

26 I also will laugh at your calamity. [.linebr]#/# +
I will mock when your fear comes,

27 When your fear comes like desolation, [.linebr]#/# +
and your destruction comes like a whirlwind, [.linebr]#/# +
when distress and anguish come upon you.

28 They shall call upon me, but I will not answer. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.

29 For they hated knowledge [.linebr]#/# +
and did not choose the fear of the LORD.

30 They rejected my counsel. [.linebr]#/# +
They despised all my reproof.

31 Therefore, they shall eat the fruit of their own way [.linebr]#/# +
and be filled with their own devices.

32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, [.linebr]#/# +
and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

33 But whoever listens to me shall dwell in safety [.linebr]#/# +
and shall be quiet from fear of evil."

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_Wisdom promises godliness to her children, 1-9; and safety from evil company, 10-19; and direction in good ways, 20-22._

1 My son, if you will receive my words [.linebr]#/# +
and hide my commandments with you,

2 So that you incline your ear to wisdom [.linebr]#/# +
and apply your heart to understanding,

3 If you even cry after knowledge [.linebr]#/# +
and lift up your voice for understanding,

4 If you seek her like silver [.linebr]#/# +
and search for her like hidden treasures,

5 Then you shall understand the fear of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and find the knowledge of God,

6 For the LORD gives wisdom. [.linebr]#/# +
Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.

7 He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous. [.linebr]#/# +
He is a buckler to those who walk uprightly.

8 He keeps the paths of judgment [.linebr]#/# +
and preserves the way of his saints.

9 Then you shall understand righteousness, judgment, [.linebr]#/# +
equity, and every good path.

10 When wisdom enters into your heart [.linebr]#/# +
and knowledge is pleasant to your soul,

11 Discretion shall preserve you, [.linebr]#/# +
understanding shall keep you,

12 To deliver you from the way of the evil men, [.linebr]#/# +
from the men who speak perverse things,

13 Who leave the paths of uprightness [.linebr]#/# +
to walk in the ways of darkness,

14 Who rejoice to do evil [.linebr]#/# +
and delight in the perverseness of the wicked,

15 Whose ways are crooked, [.linebr]#/# +
and who are perverse in their paths;

16 To deliver you from the strange woman, [.linebr]#/# +
even from the stranger who flatters with her words,

17 Who forsakes the guide of her youth [.linebr]#/# +
and forgets the covenant of her God.

18 For her house inclines to death [.linebr]#/# +
and her paths to the dead.

19 None who go to her return again, [.linebr]#/# +
neither do they take hold of the paths of life.

20 So you shall walk in the way of good men [.linebr]#/# +
and keep the paths of the righteous.

21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, [.linebr]#/# +
and the perfect shall remain in it.

22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

[#pro003%breakable]
=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Various exhortations, 1-12. The gain of wisdom, 13-26. Exhortation to doing good, etc. 27-32. The different state of the wicked and upright, 33-35._

1 My son, do not forget my law, [.linebr]#/# +
but let your heart keep my commandments,

2 For length of days, long life, [.linebr]#/# +
and peace they shall add to you.

3 Do not let mercy and truth forsake you. [.linebr]#/# +
Bind them around your neck. [.linebr]#/# +
Write them upon the tablet of your heart.

4 Then you shall find favor and good understanding [.linebr]#/# +
in the sight of God and man.

5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not lean on your own understanding.

6 In all your ways acknowledge him, [.linebr]#/# +
and he will direct your paths.

7 Do not be wise in your own eyes. [.linebr]#/# +
Fear the LORD, and depart from evil.

8 It shall be health to your body [.linebr]#/# +
and marrow to your bones.

9 Honor the LORD with your substance [.linebr]#/# +
and with the first-fruits of all your increase,

10 And your barns shall be filled with plenty, [.linebr]#/# +
and your presses shall burst out with new wine.

[[pro003-011]]11 My son, do not despise the chastening of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
neither be weary of his correction,

[[pro003-012]]12 For whom the LORD loves he corrects, [.linebr]#/# +
even as a father [corrects] the son in whom he delights.

13 Happy is the man who finds wisdom [.linebr]#/# +
and the man who gets understanding,

14 For its merchandise is better than the merchandise of silver [.linebr]#/# +
and its gain than fine gold.

15 She is more precious than rubies, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the things you can desire are not to be compared to her.

16 Length of days is in her right hand, [.linebr]#/# +
and in her left hand are riches and honor.

17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, [.linebr]#/# +
and all her paths are peace.

18 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold upon her. [.linebr]#/# +
And happy is everyone who retains her.

19 The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
By understanding he has established the heavens.

20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, [.linebr]#/# +
and the clouds drop down the dew.

21 My son, do not let them depart from your eyes. [.linebr]#/# +
Keep sound wisdom and discretion,

22 And they shall be life to your soul [.linebr]#/# +
and grace to your neck.

23 Then you shall walk in your way safely, [.linebr]#/# +
and your foot shall not stumble.

24 When you lie down, you shall not be afraid. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.

[[pro003-025]]25 Do not be afraid of sudden fear [.linebr]#/# +
or of the desolation of the wicked when it comes,

26 For the LORD will be your confidence [.linebr]#/# +
and will keep your foot from being taken.

27 Do not withhold good from them to whom it is due, [.linebr]#/# +
when it is in the power of your hand to do it.

28 Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come back, [.linebr]#/# +
and tomorrow I will give," when you have it with you.

29 Do not devise evil against your neighbor, [.linebr]#/# +
seeing he dwells securely by you.

30 Do not strive with a man without cause, [.linebr]#/# +
if he has done you no harm.

31 Do not envy the oppressor, [.linebr]#/# +
and choose none of his ways,

32 For the perverse is an abomination to the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
but his secret is with the righteous.

33 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked, [.linebr]#/# +
but he blesses the habitation of the just.

[[pro003-034]]34 Surely he scorns the scorners, [.linebr]#/# +
but he gives grace to the lowly.

35 The wise shall inherit glory, [.linebr]#/# +
but shame shall be the promotion of fools.

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_Solomon persuades to wisdom, 1-13, and to shun wickedness, 14-19. He exhorts to sanctification, 20-27._

1 Hear, children, the instruction of a father, [.linebr]#/# +
and attend to know understanding,

2 For I give you good doctrine. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not forsake my law.

3 For I was my father's son, [.linebr]#/# +
tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.

4 He taught me also, and said to me, [.linebr]#/# +
"Let your heart retain my words. [.linebr]#/# +
Keep my commandments, and live.

5 Get wisdom. Get understanding. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not forget it. Do not decline from the words of my mouth.

6 Do not forsake her, and she shall preserve you. [.linebr]#/# +
Love her, and she shall keep you.

7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore, get wisdom. [.linebr]#/# +
And with all your getting get understanding.

8 Exalt her, and she shall promote you. [.linebr]#/# +
She shall bring you to honor when you embrace her.

9 She shall give to your head an ornament of grace. [.linebr]#/# +
A crown of glory she shall deliver to you."

10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings, [.linebr]#/# +
and the years of your life shall be many.

11 I have taught you in the way of wisdom. [.linebr]#/# +
I have led you in right paths.

12 When you go, your steps shall not be hindered, [.linebr]#/# +
and when you run, you shall not stumble.

13 Take firm hold of instruction. Do not let her go. [.linebr]#/# +
Keep her, for she is your life.

14 Do not enter into the path of the wicked, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not go in the way of evil men.

15 Avoid it, do not pass by it, [.linebr]#/# +
turn from it, and pass on.

16 For they do not sleep, unless they have done mischief, [.linebr]#/# +
and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

17 For they eat the bread of wickedness [.linebr]#/# +
and drink the wine of violence.

18 But the path of the just is like the shining light [.linebr]#/# +
that shines more and more to the perfect day.

19 The way of the wicked is like darkness. [.linebr]#/# +
They do not know at what they stumble.

20 My son, attend to my words. [.linebr]#/# +
Incline your ear to my sayings.

21 Do not let them depart from your eyes. [.linebr]#/# +
Keep them in the midst of your heart.

22 For they are life to those who find them [.linebr]#/# +
and health to all their flesh.

23 Keep your heart with all diligence, [.linebr]#/# +
for out of it flows the source of life.

24 Put away from you a crooked mouth, [.linebr]#/# +
and perverse lips put far from you.

25 Let your eyes look right on, [.linebr]#/# +
and let your eyelids look straight before you.

26 Ponder the path of your feet, [.linebr]#/# +
and let all your ways be established.

27 Do not turn to the right hand or to the left. [.linebr]#/# +
Turn your foot away from evil.

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_Solomon exhorts to wisdom, 1, 2. He shows the mischief of lewdness and riot, 3-14. He exhorts to contentedness, liberality, and chastity, 15-21. The wicked are overtaken with their own sins, 22, 23._

1 My son, attend to my wisdom [.linebr]#/# +
and bow your ear to my understanding,

2 So that you may regard discretion, [.linebr]#/# +
and that your lips may keep knowledge.

3 For the lips of a strange woman drop like a honey-comb, [.linebr]#/# +
and her mouth is smoother than oil,

4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, [.linebr]#/# +
sharp as a two-edged sword.

5 Her feet go down to death. [.linebr]#/# +
Her steps take hold upon hell.

6 She does not ponder the path of life. [.linebr]#/# +
Her ways are movable, and she does not know it.

7 Hear me now therefore, O children, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not depart from the words of my mouth.

8 Keep your way far from her, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not come near the door of her house,

9 Lest you give your honor to others [.linebr]#/# +
and your years to the cruel,

10 Lest strangers be filled with your wealth [.linebr]#/# +
and your labors be in the house of a stranger,

11 And you mourn at the last [.linebr]#/# +
when your flesh and your body are consumed,

12 And say, "How I have hated instruction, [.linebr]#/# +
and my heart despised reproof,

13 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, [.linebr]#/# +
nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!

14 I was almost in all evil [.linebr]#/# +
in the midst of the congregation and assembly."

15 Drink waters out of your own cistern, [.linebr]#/# +
and running waters out of your own well.

16 Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, [.linebr]#/# +
and rivers of waters in the streets.

17 Let them be only your own, [.linebr]#/# +
and not for strangers with you.

18 Let your fountain be blessed, [.linebr]#/# +
and rejoice with the wife of your youth.

19 Let her be as the loving doe and pleasant deer. [.linebr]#/# +
Let her breasts satisfy you at all times, [.linebr]#/# +
and be ravished always with her love.

20 And why will you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman [.linebr]#/# +
and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and he ponders all his goings.

22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, [.linebr]#/# +
and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.

23 He shall die without instruction, [.linebr]#/# +
and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_Against suretyship, 1-5; idleness, 6-11; and mischievousness, 12-15. Seven things hateful to God, 16-19. The blessings of obedience, 20-24. The mischiefs of lewdness, 25-35._

1 My son, if you are surety for your friend, [.linebr]#/# +
if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,

2 You are snared with the words of your mouth, [.linebr]#/# +
you are taken with the words of your mouth.

3 Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself [.linebr]#/# +
when you have come into the hand of your friend: [.linebr]#/# +
go, humble yourself, and make urgent request to your friend.

4 Do not give sleep to your eyes, [.linebr]#/# +
nor slumber to your eyelids.

5 Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter [.linebr]#/# +
and like a bird from the hand of the fowler.

6 Go to the ant, you sluggard. [.linebr]#/# +
Consider her ways and be wise.

7 She, having no guide, [.linebr]#/# +
overseer, or ruler,

8 Provides her provisions in the summer [.linebr]#/# +
and gathers her food in the harvest.

9 How long will you sleep, O sluggard? [.linebr]#/# +
When will you arise out of your sleep?

10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, [.linebr]#/# +
a little folding of the hands to sleep,

11 And your poverty shall come as one who travels, [.linebr]#/# +
and your lack as an armed man.

12 A worthless person, a wicked man, [.linebr]#/# +
walks with a crooked mouth.

13 He winks with his eyes. [.linebr]#/# +
He speaks with his feet. [.linebr]#/# +
He teaches with his fingers.

14 Perverseness is in his heart. [.linebr]#/# +
He devises mischief continually. [.linebr]#/# +
He sows discord.

15 Therefore, his calamity shall come suddenly. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall be suddenly broken without remedy.

16 These six things the LORD hates, [.linebr]#/# +
even seven are abominations to him:

17 A proud look, a lying tongue, [.linebr]#/# +
hands that shed innocent blood,

18 A heart that devises wicked imaginations, [.linebr]#/# +
feet that are swift in running to mischief,

19 A false witness who speaks lies, [.linebr]#/# +
and him who sows discord among brothers.

20 My son, keep your father's commandment [.linebr]#/# +
and do not forsake the law of your mother.

21 Bind them continually upon your heart [.linebr]#/# +
and tie them around your neck.

22 When you go, it shall lead you. [.linebr]#/# +
When you sleep, it shall keep you. [.linebr]#/# +
And when you awake, it shall talk with you.

23 For the commandment is a lamp, the law is light, [.linebr]#/# +
and reproofs of instruction are the way of life,

24 To keep you from the evil woman, [.linebr]#/# +
from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.

25 Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, [.linebr]#/# +
neither let her take you with her eyelids.

26 For by means of a lewd woman a man is brought to a piece of bread, [.linebr]#/# +
and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.

27 Can a man take fire in his bosom [.linebr]#/# +
and his clothes not be burned?

28 Can one go upon hot coals [.linebr]#/# +
and his feet not be burned?

29 Such is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife. [.linebr]#/# +
Whoever touches her shall not be innocent.

30 Men do not despise a thief if he steals [.linebr]#/# +
to satisfy his soul when he is hungry.

31 But if he is found, he shall restore seven-fold. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall give all the substance of his house.

32 But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding. [.linebr]#/# +
He who does it destroys his own soul.

33 He shall get a wound and dishonor, [.linebr]#/# +
and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

34 For jealousy is the rage of a man; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

35 He will not regard any ransom, [.linebr]#/# +
neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.

=== Chapter 7

[.outline.text-center]
_Solomon persuades to a sincere and kind familiarity with wisdom, 1-5. In an example of his own experience, he shows, 6-9, the cunning of a harlot, 10-21; and the desperate simplicity of a young incontinent man, 22, 23. He dissuades from such wickedness, 24-27._

1 My son, keep my words [.linebr]#/# +
and lay up my commandments with you.

2 Keep my commandments and live, [.linebr]#/# +
and my law as the apple of your eye.

3 Bind them upon your fingers. [.linebr]#/# +
Write them upon the tablet of your heart.

4 Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," [.linebr]#/# +
and call understanding your kinswoman,

5 So that they may keep you from the strange woman, [.linebr]#/# +
from the stranger who flatters with her words.

6 For at the window of my house [.linebr]#/# +
I looked through my casement

7 And beheld among the simple ones. [.linebr]#/# +
I discerned among the youths [.linebr]#/# +
a young man void of understanding,

8 Passing through the street near her corner. [.linebr]#/# +
And he went the way to her house,

9 In the twilight, in the evening, [.linebr]#/# +
in the black and dark night.

10 And behold, a woman met him [.linebr]#/# +
with the attire of a harlot and subtle of heart.

11 (She is loud and stubborn. [.linebr]#/# +
Her feet do not abide in her house.

12 Now she is outside, now in the streets, [.linebr]#/# +
and lies in wait at every corner.)

13 So she caught him, kissed him, [.linebr]#/# +
and with an impudent face said to him,

14 "I have peace-offerings with me. [.linebr]#/# +
This day I have paid my vows.

15 Therefore, I came forth to meet you, [.linebr]#/# +
diligently to seek your face, and I have found you.

16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, [.linebr]#/# +
with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.

17 I have perfumed my bed [.linebr]#/# +
with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning. [.linebr]#/# +
Let us solace ourselves with affection.

19 For the husband is not at home. [.linebr]#/# +
He has gone on a long journey.

20 He has taken a bag of money with him [.linebr]#/# +
and will come home at the day appointed."

21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield. [.linebr]#/# +
With the flattering of her lips she impelled him.

22 He goes after her quickly, [.linebr]#/# +
like an ox goes to the slaughter, [.linebr]#/# +
or like a fool to the correction of the stocks,

23 Until a dart strikes through his liver, [.linebr]#/# +
as a bird hastens to the snare, [.linebr]#/# +
and does not know that it is for his life.

24 Now therefore, listen to me, O children, [.linebr]#/# +
and attend to the words of my mouth.

25 Do not let your heart decline to her ways. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not go astray in her paths.

26 For she has cast down many wounded, [.linebr]#/# +
and many strong men have been slain by her.

27 Her house is the way to hell, [.linebr]#/# +
going down to the chambers of death.

=== Chapter 8

[.outline.text-center]
_The fame, 1-5, and evidence of wisdom, 6-9. The excellency, 10, 11, the nature, 12-14, the power, 15-17, the riches, 18-21, and the eternity of wisdom, 22-31. Wisdom is to be desired for the blessedness it brings, 32-36._

1 Does wisdom not cry, [.linebr]#/# +
and understanding put forth her voice?

2 She stands on the top of high places, [.linebr]#/# +
by the way in the places of the paths.

3 She cries at the gates, at the entry of the city, [.linebr]#/# +
at the entrance of the doors,

4 "To you, O men, I call, [.linebr]#/# +
and my voice is to the sons of man.

5 O you simple, understand wisdom, [.linebr]#/# +
and you fools, be of an understanding heart.

6 Hear, for I will speak of excellent things, [.linebr]#/# +
and the opening of my lips shall be right things.

7 For my mouth shall speak truth, [.linebr]#/# +
and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. [.linebr]#/# +
There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.

9 They are all plain to him who understands, [.linebr]#/# +
and right to those who find knowledge.

10 Receive my instruction instead of silver, [.linebr]#/# +
and knowledge rather than choice gold.

11 For wisdom is better than rubies, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.

12 I, wisdom, dwell with prudence [.linebr]#/# +
and find out knowledge of ingenious inventions.

13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil. [.linebr]#/# +
Pride, arrogance, the evil way, [.linebr]#/# +
and the perverse mouth, I hate.

14 Counsel and sound wisdom are mine. [.linebr]#/# +
I am understanding. I have strength.

15 By me kings reign [.linebr]#/# +
and princes decree justice.

16 By me princes rule, [.linebr]#/# +
and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.

17 I love those who love me, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who seek me early shall find me.

18 Riches and honor are with me, [.linebr]#/# +
durable riches and righteousness.

19 My fruit is better than gold, [.linebr]#/# +
even fine gold, and my revenue than choice silver.

20 I lead in the way of righteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
in the midst of the paths of judgment,

21 So that I may cause those who love me to inherit substance. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will fill their treasures.

22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, [.linebr]#/# +
before his works of old.

23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, [.linebr]#/# +
before the earth was.

24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth, [.linebr]#/# +
when there were no fountains abounding with water.

25 Before the mountains were settled, [.linebr]#/# +
before the hills, I was brought forth,

26 While he had not yet made the earth, the fields, [.linebr]#/# +
nor the highest part of the dust of the world.

27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there. [.linebr]#/# +
When he set a compass upon the face of the depth,

28 When he established the clouds above, [.linebr]#/# +
when he strengthened the fountains of the deep,

29 When he gave to the sea his decree [.linebr]#/# +
that the waters should not pass his commandment, [.linebr]#/# +
and when he appointed the foundations of the earth,

30 I was by him, as one brought up with him, [.linebr]#/# +
and I was daily his delight, [.linebr]#/# +
rejoicing always before him,

31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth. [.linebr]#/# +
And my delights were with the sons of men.

32 Now therefore, listen to me, O children, [.linebr]#/# +
for blessed are those who keep my ways.

33 Hear instruction and be wise, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not refuse it.

34 Blessed is the man who hears me, [.linebr]#/# +
watching daily at my gates, [.linebr]#/# +
waiting at the posts of my doors.

35 For whoever finds me finds life [.linebr]#/# +
and obtains favor from the LORD.

36 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul. [.linebr]#/# +
All those who hate me love death."

1 Wisdom has built her house. [.linebr]#/# +
She has hewn out her seven pillars.

2 She has killed her beasts. She has mingled her wine. [.linebr]#/# +
She has also furnished her table.

3 She has sent forth her attendants. [.linebr]#/# +
She cries upon the highest places of the city,

4 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here." [.linebr]#/# +
As for him who lacks understanding, she says to him,

5 "Come, eat my bread, [.linebr]#/# +
and drink the wine which I have mingled.

6 Forsake the foolish and live. [.linebr]#/# +
And go in the way of understanding."

7 He who reproves a scorner gets shame for himself. [.linebr]#/# +
And he who rebukes a wicked man gets himself a blot.

8 Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate you. [.linebr]#/# +
Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.

9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be wiser still. [.linebr]#/# +
Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.

10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, [.linebr]#/# +
and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.

11 For by me your days shall be multiplied, [.linebr]#/# +
and the years of your life shall be increased.

12 If you are wise, you shall be wise for yourself, [.linebr]#/# +
but if you scorn, you alone shall bear it.

13 A foolish woman is clamorous. [.linebr]#/# +
She is simple and knows nothing.

14 For she sits at the door of her house, [.linebr]#/# +
on a seat in the high places of the city,

15 To call to passengers [.linebr]#/# +
who go right on their ways,

16 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here." [.linebr]#/# +
And as for him who lacks understanding, she says to him,

17 "Stolen waters are sweet, [.linebr]#/# +
and bread eaten in secret is pleasant."

18 But he does not know that the dead are there, [.linebr]#/# +
and that her guests are in the depths of hell.

_From this chapter to the twenty-fifth are various observations of moral virtues, and their contrary vices, 1-32._

1 [_The proverbs of Solomon._]

A wise son makes a glad father, [.linebr]#/# +
but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, [.linebr]#/# +
but righteousness delivers from death.

3 The LORD will not allow the soul of the righteous to famish, [.linebr]#/# +
but he casts away the substance of the wicked.

4 He becomes poor who deals with a slack hand, [.linebr]#/# +
but the hand of the diligent makes rich.

5 He who gathers in summer is a wise son, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.

6 Blessings are upon the head of the just, [.linebr]#/# +
but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.

7 The memory of the just is blessed, [.linebr]#/# +
but the name of the wicked shall perish.

8 The wise in heart will receive commandments, [.linebr]#/# +
but a prating fool shall fall.

9 He who walks uprightly walks surely, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who perverts his ways shall be known.

10 He who winks with the eye causes sorrow, [.linebr]#/# +
but a prating fool shall fall.

11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life, [.linebr]#/# +
but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.

12 Hatred stirs up strife, [.linebr]#/# +
but love covers all sins.

13 In the lips of him who has understanding, wisdom is found, [.linebr]#/# +
but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.

14 Wise men lay up knowledge, [.linebr]#/# +
but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.

15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city. [.linebr]#/# +
The destruction of the poor is their poverty.

16 The labor of the righteous tends to life, [.linebr]#/# +
but the fruit of the wicked to sin.

17 He is in the way of life who keeps instruction, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who refuses reproof errs.

18 He who hides hatred has lying lips, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who utters a slander is a fool.

19 In the multitude of words there is no lack of sin, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who restrains his lips is wise.

20 The tongue of the just is like choice silver. [.linebr]#/# +
The heart of the wicked is of little worth.

21 The lips of the righteous feed many, [.linebr]#/# +
but fools die for lack of wisdom.

22 The blessing of the LORD, it makes rich, [.linebr]#/# +
and he adds no sorrow with it.

23 To do mischief is pleasure to a fool, [.linebr]#/# +
but a man of understanding has wisdom.

24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him, [.linebr]#/# +
but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.

25 As the whirlwind passes, so is the wicked no more, [.linebr]#/# +
but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.

26 As vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes, [.linebr]#/# +
so is the sluggard to those who send him.

27 The fear of the LORD prolongs days, [.linebr]#/# +
but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.

28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness, [.linebr]#/# +
but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.

29 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright, [.linebr]#/# +
but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.

30 The righteous shall never be removed, [.linebr]#/# +
but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.

31 The mouth of the just brings forth wisdom, [.linebr]#/# +
but the perverse tongue shall be cut out.

32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, [.linebr]#/# +
but the mouth of the wicked speaks perverseness.

1 A false balance is an abomination to the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
but a just weight is his delight.

2 When pride comes, shame comes, [.linebr]#/# +
but with the lowly is wisdom.

3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them, [.linebr]#/# +
but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

4 Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, [.linebr]#/# +
but righteousness delivers from death.

5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way, [.linebr]#/# +
but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, [.linebr]#/# +
but transgressors shall be taken in their own desires.

7 When a wicked man dies, his expectation shall perish, [.linebr]#/# +
and the hope of unjust men perishes.

8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, [.linebr]#/# +
and the wicked comes in his stead.

9 A hypocrite destroys his neighbor with his mouth, [.linebr]#/# +
but through knowledge the just shall be delivered.

10 When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices, [.linebr]#/# +
and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.

11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted, [.linebr]#/# +
but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

12 He who is void of wisdom despises his neighbor, [.linebr]#/# +
but a man of understanding holds his peace.

13 A gossiper reveals secrets, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter.

14 Where no counsel is, the people fall, [.linebr]#/# +
but in the multitude of counselors there is safety.

15 He who is surety for a stranger shall suffer for it, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who hates suretyship is secure.

16 A gracious woman retains honor, [.linebr]#/# +
and strong men retain riches.

17 The merciful man does good to his own soul, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.

18 The wicked works a deceitful work, [.linebr]#/# +
but to him who sows righteousness shall be a sure reward.

19 As righteousness tends to life, [.linebr]#/# +
so he who pursues evil pursues it to his own death.

20 Those who are of a perverse heart are abominations to the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
but those who are upright in their way are his delight.

21 Though hand joins in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished, [.linebr]#/# +
but the offspring of the righteous shall be delivered.

22 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, [.linebr]#/# +
so is a fair woman who is without discretion.

23 The desire of the righteous is only good, [.linebr]#/# +
but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.

24 There is one who scatters, [.linebr]#/# +
and yet increases, [.linebr]#/# +
and there is one who withholds more than is proper, [.linebr]#/# +
but it tends to poverty.

25 The liberal soul shall be made fat, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who waters shall be watered also himself.

26 He who withholds grain, the people shall curse him, [.linebr]#/# +
but blessing shall be upon the head of him who sells it.

27 He who diligently seeks good procures favor, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who seeks mischief, it shall come to him.

28 He who trusts in his riches shall fall, [.linebr]#/# +
but the righteous shall flourish like a branch.

29 He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind, [.linebr]#/# +
and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.

30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who wins souls is wise.

[[pro011-031]]31 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed upon the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
much more the wicked and the sinner.

25 Heaviness in the heart of man depresses it, [.linebr]#/# +

26 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbor, [.linebr]#/# +
but the way of the wicked seduces them.

27 The slothful man does not roast that which he took in hunting, [.linebr]#/# +

27 An ungodly man digs up evil, [.linebr]#/# +
and his speech is like a burning fire.

28 A perverse man sows strife, [.linebr]#/# +
and a whisperer separates chief friends.

29 A violent man entices his neighbor [.linebr]#/# +
and leads him into the way that is not good.

30 He shuts his eyes to devise perverse things. [.linebr]#/# +
Moving his lips he brings evil to pass.

31 The hoary head is a crown of glory, [.linebr]#/# +
if it is found in the way of righteousness.

32 He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.

33 The lot is cast into the lap, [.linebr]#/# +
but its every verdict is from the LORD.

_Various observations of moral virtues, and their contrary vices, 1-28._

1 Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it, [.linebr]#/# +
than a house full of sacrifices with strife.

2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son who causes shame, [.linebr]#/# +
and shall have part of the inheritance among the brothers.

3 The refining-pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, [.linebr]#/# +
but the LORD tries the hearts.

4 A wicked doer gives heed to false lips, [.linebr]#/# +
and a liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.

5 He who mocks the poor reproaches his Maker, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.

6 Children's children are the crown of old men, [.linebr]#/# +
and the glory of children is their fathers.

7 Excellent speech is not suitable for a fool, [.linebr]#/# +
much less are lying lips for a prince.

8 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him who has it. [.linebr]#/# +
Wherever it turns, it prospers.

9 He who covers a transgression seeks love, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who repeats a matter separates chief friends.

10 A reproof enters more into a wise man [.linebr]#/# +
than one hundred stripes into a fool.

11 An evil man seeks only rebellion; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.

12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, [.linebr]#/# +
rather than a fool in his folly.

13 Whoever rewards evil for good, [.linebr]#/# +
evil shall not depart from his house.

14 The beginning of strife is like when one lets out water; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, withdraw from contention before it is meddled with.

15 He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the just, [.linebr]#/# +
even the both of them are abominations to the LORD.

16 Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, [.linebr]#/# +
seeing he has no heart to it?

17 A friend loves at all times, [.linebr]#/# +
and a brother is born for adversity.

18 A man void of understanding strikes hands [.linebr]#/# +
and becomes surety in the presence of his friend.

19 He loves transgression who loves strife. [.linebr]#/# +
And he who exalts his gate seeks destruction.

20 He who has a perverse heart finds no good, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who has a deceitful tongue falls into mischief.

21 He who begets a fool does it to his sorrow. [.linebr]#/# +
And the father of a fool has no joy.

22 A merry heart does good like a medicine, [.linebr]#/# +
but a broken spirit dries the bones.

23 A wicked man takes a gift out of the bosom [.linebr]#/# +
to pervert the ways of judgment.

24 Wisdom is before him who has understanding, [.linebr]#/# +
but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.

25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, [.linebr]#/# +
and bitterness to her who bore him.

26 Also to punish the just is not good, [.linebr]#/# +
nor to strike princes for equity.

27 He who has knowledge spares his words, [.linebr]#/# +
and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.

28 Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wise, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who shuts his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

_Various observations of moral virtues, and their contrary vices, 1-24._

1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, [.linebr]#/# +
seeks and intermeddles with all wisdom.

2 A fool has no delight in understanding, [.linebr]#/# +
but only that his heart may reveal itself.

3 When the wicked comes, then contempt also comes, [.linebr]#/# +
and with ignominy comes reproach.

4 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, [.linebr]#/# +
and the well-spring of wisdom as a flowing brook.

5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked [.linebr]#/# +
or to overthrow the righteous in judgment.

6 A fool's lips enter into contention, [.linebr]#/# +
and his mouth calls for strokes.

7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, [.linebr]#/# +
and his lips are the snare of his soul.

8 The words of a gossiper are like dainty morsels, [.linebr]#/# +
and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.

9 He also who is slothful in his work [.linebr]#/# +
is brother to him who is a great waster.

10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower. [.linebr]#/# +
The righteous runs to it and is safe.

11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, [.linebr]#/# +
and like a high wall in his own conceit.

12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, [.linebr]#/# +
and before honor is humility.

13 He who answers a matter before he hears it, [.linebr]#/# +
it is folly and shame to him.

14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity, [.linebr]#/# +
but who can bear a wounded spirit?

15 The heart of the prudent gets knowledge, [.linebr]#/# +
and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.

16 A man's gift makes room for him, [.linebr]#/# +
and brings him before great men.

17 He who is first in his own cause seems just, [.linebr]#/# +
but his neighbor comes and searches him.

18 The lot causes contentions to cease [.linebr]#/# +
and parts between the mighty.

19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city, [.linebr]#/# +
and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.

20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth. [.linebr]#/# +
And with the increase of his lips he shall be filled.

21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who love it shall eat its fruit.

22 Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing [.linebr]#/# +
and obtains favor from the LORD.

23 The poor uses entreaties, [.linebr]#/# +
but the rich answers roughly.

24 A man of many friends may come to ruin, [.linebr]#/# +
but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

1 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, [.linebr]#/# +
than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.

2 Also, for the soul to be without knowledge, it is not good. [.linebr]#/# +
And he who hastens with his feet sins.

3 The foolishness of man perverts his way, [.linebr]#/# +
and his heart frets against the LORD.

4 Wealth makes many friends, [.linebr]#/# +
but the poor is separated from his neighbor.

5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who speaks lies shall not escape.

6 Many will entreat the favor of the prince. [.linebr]#/# +
And every man is a friend to him who gives gifts.

7 All the brothers of the poor hate him. [.linebr]#/# +
How much more do his friends go far from him? [.linebr]#/# +
He pursues them with words, yet they are no more.

8 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. [.linebr]#/# +
He who keeps understanding shall find good.

9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who speaks lies shall perish.

10 Delight is not appropriate for a fool, [.linebr]#/# +
much less for a servant to have rule over princes.

11 The discretion of a man defers his anger, [.linebr]#/# +
and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.

12 The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, [.linebr]#/# +
but his favor is like dew upon the grass.

13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father, [.linebr]#/# +
and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.

14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers, [.linebr]#/# +
but a prudent wife is from the LORD.

15 Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep, [.linebr]#/# +
and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.

16 He who keeps the commandment keeps his own soul, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who despises his ways shall die.

17 He who has pity upon the poor lends to the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and that which he has given he will pay him back.

18 Chasten your son while there is hope, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not let your soul spare for his crying.

19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment, [.linebr]#/# +
for if you deliver him, yet you must do it again.

20 Hear counsel and receive instruction [.linebr]#/# +
so that you may be wise in your latter end.

21 There are many devices in a man's heart, [.linebr]#/# +
but the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

22 The desire of a man is his kindness. [.linebr]#/# +
And a poor man is better than a liar.

23 The fear of the LORD tends to life, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who has it shall abide satisfied. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall not be visited with evil.

24 A slothful man hides his hand in his bosom [.linebr]#/# +
and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.

25 Smite a scorner and the simple will take heed. [.linebr]#/# +
And reprove one who has understanding and he will understand knowledge.

26 He who wastes his father and chases away his mother [.linebr]#/# +
is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.

27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction [.linebr]#/# +
that causes you to err from the words of knowledge.

28 An ungodly witness scorns judgment, [.linebr]#/# +
and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.

29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, [.linebr]#/# +

_Various observations of moral virtues, and their contrary vices, 1-30._

1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging, [.linebr]#/# +
and whoever is deceived by it is not wise.

2 The fear of a king is like the roaring of a lion. [.linebr]#/# +
Whoever provokes him to anger sins against his own soul.

3 It is an honor for a man to cease from strife, [.linebr]#/# +
but every fool will be meddling.

4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, he shall beg in harvest and have nothing.

5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, [.linebr]#/# +
but a man of understanding will draw it out.

6 Most men will each proclaim his own goodness, [.linebr]#/# +
but who can find a faithful man?

7 The just man walks in his integrity. [.linebr]#/# +
His children are blessed after him.

8 A king who sits on the throne of judgment [.linebr]#/# +
scatters away all evil with his eyes.

9 Who can say, "I have made my heart clean. [.linebr]#/# +
I am pure from my sin"?

10 Diverse weights and diverse measures, [.linebr]#/# +
both of them are alike abominations to the LORD.

11 Even a child is known by his doings, [.linebr]#/# +
whether his work is pure and whether it is right.

12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye, [.linebr]#/# +
the LORD has made even both of them.

13 Do not love sleep, lest you come to poverty. [.linebr]#/# +
Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.

14 "It is nothing, it is nothing," says the buyer, [.linebr]#/# +
but when he is gone, then he boasts.

15 There is gold and a multitude of rubies, [.linebr]#/# +
but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.

16 Take his garment who is surety for a stranger, [.linebr]#/# +
and hold him in pledge for a strange woman.

17 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man, [.linebr]#/# +
but afterward his mouth shall be filled with gravel.

18 Every purpose is established by counsel, [.linebr]#/# +
and with good advice make war.

19 He who goes around as a gossiper reveals secrets; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, do not meddle with him who flatters with his lips.

20 Whoever curses his father or his mother, [.linebr]#/# +
his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.

21 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning, [.linebr]#/# +
but its end shall not be blessed.

22 Do not say, "I will recompense evil." [.linebr]#/# +
But wait on the LORD, and he shall save you.

23 Diverse weights are an abomination to the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and a false balance is not good.

24 Man's goings are of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
How can a man then understand his own way?

25 It is a snare to the man who devours that which is holy [.linebr]#/# +
and later vows to make inquiry.

26 A wise king scatters the wicked [.linebr]#/# +
and brings the wheel over them.

27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
searching all the inward parts of the belly.

28 Mercy and truth preserve the king, [.linebr]#/# +
and his throne is upheld by mercy.

29 The glory of young men is their strength, [.linebr]#/# +
and the beauty of old men is the gray head.

30 The blueness of a wound cleanses away evil, [.linebr]#/# +

1 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD like channels of water. [.linebr]#/# +
He turns it wherever he pleases.

2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, [.linebr]#/# +
but the LORD ponders the hearts.

3 To do justice and judgment [.linebr]#/# +
is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.

4 A high look and a proud heart, [.linebr]#/# +
which is the lamp of the wicked, is sin.

5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
but of everyone who is hasty, only to poverty.

6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue [.linebr]#/# +
is a vanity tossed to and fro by those who seek death.

7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them, [.linebr]#/# +
because they refuse to do judgment.

8 Crooked is the way of a guilty man, [.linebr]#/# +
but as for the pure, his work is right.

9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the house-top, [.linebr]#/# +
than with a brawling woman in a wide house.

10 The soul of the wicked desires evil. [.linebr]#/# +
His neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.

11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise. [.linebr]#/# +
And when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.

12 The righteous man wisely considers the house of the wicked, [.linebr]#/# +
but God overthrows the wicked for their wickedness.

13 Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, [.linebr]#/# +
he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.

14 A gift in secret pacifies anger, [.linebr]#/# +
and a reward in the bosom, strong wrath.

15 It is joy to the just to do judgment, [.linebr]#/# +
but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.

16 The man who wanders out of the way of understanding [.linebr]#/# +
shall remain in the congregation of the dead.

17 He who loves pleasure shall be a poor man. [.linebr]#/# +
He who loves wine and oil shall not be rich.

18 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, [.linebr]#/# +
and the transgressor for the upright.

19 It is better to dwell in the wilderness [.linebr]#/# +
than with a contentious and angry woman.

20 There is a treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of the wise, [.linebr]#/# +
but a foolish man spends it up.

21 He who follows after righteousness and mercy [.linebr]#/# +
finds life, righteousness, and honor.

22 A wise man scales the city of the mighty [.linebr]#/# +
and casts down the strength of its confidence.

23 Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue [.linebr]#/# +
keeps his soul from troubles.

24 The proud and haughty man, "Scoffer," is his name. [.linebr]#/# +
He works in the arrogance of pride.

25 The desire of the slothful kills him, [.linebr]#/# +
for his hands refuse to labor.

26 He covets greedily all the day long, [.linebr]#/# +
but the righteous gives and does not spare.

27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination. [.linebr]#/# +
How much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind?

28 A false witness shall perish, [.linebr]#/# +
but the man who listens shall speak forever.

29 A wicked man hardens his face, [.linebr]#/# +
but as for the upright, he directs his way.

30 There is no wisdom nor understanding [.linebr]#/# +
nor counsel against the LORD.

22 Do not rob the poor, because he is poor, [.linebr]#/# +
neither oppress the afflicted in the gate,

and plunder the soul of those who plundered them.

24 Make no friendship with an angry man, [.linebr]#/# +

why should he take away your bed from under you?

3 Through wisdom a house is built, [.linebr]#/# +

5 A wise man is strong, [.linebr]#/# +

7 Wisdom is too high for a fool. [.linebr]#/# +
He does not open his mouth in the gate.

8 He who devises to do evil [.linebr]#/# +
shall be called a mischievous person.

9 The thought of foolishness is sin, [.linebr]#/# +

the people shall curse him, nations shall abhor him.

25 But to those who rebuke him shall be delight, [.linebr]#/# +
and a good blessing shall come upon them.

26 Every man shall kiss his lips [.linebr]#/# +
who gives a right answer.

27 Prepare your work outside [.linebr]#/# +
and make it fit for yourself in the field, [.linebr]#/# +
and afterward, build your house.

28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not deceive with your lips.

29 Do not say, "I will do so to him as he has done to me. [.linebr]#/# +
I will render to the man according to his work."

30 I went by the field of the slothful [.linebr]#/# +
and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding,

31 And behold, it was all grown over with thorns, [.linebr]#/# +
nettles had covered its face, [.linebr]#/# +
and its stone wall was broken down.

32 Then I saw and considered it well. [.linebr]#/# +
I looked upon it and received instruction.

33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, [.linebr]#/# +
a little folding of the hands to sleep,

34 And your poverty shall come as one who travels, [.linebr]#/# +
and your need as an armed man.

_Observations about kings, 1-7, and about avoiding causes of quarrels, and various causes thereof, 8-28._

1 [_These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out._]

2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, [.linebr]#/# +
but the honor of kings is to search out a matter.

3 The heaven for height and the earth for depth, [.linebr]#/# +
and the heart of kings is unsearchable.

4 Take away the dross from the silver, [.linebr]#/# +
and there shall come forth a vessel for the refiner.

5 Take away the wicked from before the king, [.linebr]#/# +
and his throne shall be established in righteousness.

6 Do not put forth yourself in the presence of the king, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not stand in the place of great men,

7 For it is better that it be said to you, "Come up here," [.linebr]#/# +
than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince [.linebr]#/# +
whom your eyes have seen.

8 Do not go forth hastily to strive, [.linebr]#/# +
lest you not know what to do in the end thereof [.linebr]#/# +
when your neighbor has put you to shame.

9 Debate your cause with your neighbor himself, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not reveal a secret to another,

10 Lest he who hears it put you to shame, [.linebr]#/# +
and your infamy not turn away.

11 A word fitly spoken [.linebr]#/# +
is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.

12 As an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold, [.linebr]#/# +
so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, [.linebr]#/# +
so is a faithful messenger to those who send him, [.linebr]#/# +
for he refreshes the soul of his masters.

14 Whoever boasts himself of a false gift [.linebr]#/# +
is like clouds and wind without rain.

15 By long forbearing a prince is persuaded, [.linebr]#/# +
and a soft tongue breaks the bone.

16 Have you found honey? Eat so much as is sufficient for you, [.linebr]#/# +
lest you be filled with it and vomit it.

17 Withdraw your foot from your neighbor's house, [.linebr]#/# +
lest he be weary of you and thus hate you.

18 A man who bears false witness against his neighbor [.linebr]#/# +
is a maul, a sword, and a sharp arrow.

19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble [.linebr]#/# +
is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint.

20 As he who takes away a garment in cold weather, [.linebr]#/# +
and as vinegar upon soda, [.linebr]#/# +
so is he who sings songs to a heavy heart.

[[pro025-021]]21 If your enemy hungers, give him bread to eat, [.linebr]#/# +
and if he thirsts, give him water to drink,

[[pro025-022]]22 For you shall heap coals of fire upon his head, [.linebr]#/# +
and the LORD will reward you.

23 The north wind drives away rain, [.linebr]#/# +
and so does an angry countenance to a backbiting tongue.

24 It is better to dwell in a corner of the house-top [.linebr]#/# +
than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.

25 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, [.linebr]#/# +
so is good news from a far country.

26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked [.linebr]#/# +
is as a turbid fountain and a corrupt spring.

27 It is not good to eat much honey. [.linebr]#/# +
And for men to search their own glory is not glory.

28 He who has no rule over his own spirit [.linebr]#/# +
is like a city that is broken down and without walls.

_Observations about fools, 1-12; about sluggards, 13-16; and about contentious busy-bodies, 17-28._

1 As snow in summer and as rain in harvest, [.linebr]#/# +
so honor is not appropriate for a fool.

2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, [.linebr]#/# +
so the causeless curse shall not come.

3 A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, [.linebr]#/# +
and a rod for the fool's back.

4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, [.linebr]#/# +
lest you also be like him.

5 Answer a fool according to his folly, [.linebr]#/# +
lest he be wise in his own conceit.

6 He who sends a message by the hand of a fool [.linebr]#/# +
cuts off the feet and drinks damage.

7 The legs of the lame are not equal, [.linebr]#/# +
and so is a parable in the mouth of fools.

8 As he who binds a stone in a sling, [.linebr]#/# +
so is he who gives honor to a fool.

9 As a thorn goes up into the hand of a drunkard, [.linebr]#/# +
so is a parable in the mouth of fools.

10 The great God who formed all things [.linebr]#/# +
both rewards the fool and rewards transgressors.

[[pro026-011]]11 As a dog returns to his vomit, [.linebr]#/# +
so a fool returns to his folly.

12 Do you see a man wise in his own conceit? [.linebr]#/# +
There is more hope for a fool than for him.

13 The slothful man says, "There is a lion in the way. [.linebr]#/# +
A lion is in the streets."

14 As the door turns upon its hinges, [.linebr]#/# +
so does the slothful upon his bed.

15 The slothful hides his hand in his bosom. [.linebr]#/# +
It grieves him to bring it back to his mouth.

16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit [.linebr]#/# +
than seven men who can render a reason.

17 He who passes by and meddles with strife not belonging to him [.linebr]#/# +
is like one who takes a dog by the ears.

18 As a mad man who casts fire-brands, [.linebr]#/# +
arrows, and death,

19 So is the man who deceives his neighbor, [.linebr]#/# +
and says, "Am I not joking?"

20 Where there is no wood, the fire goes out. [.linebr]#/# +
And where there is no gossiper, the strife ceases.

21 As coals are to burning coals and wood to fire, [.linebr]#/# +
so is a contentious man to kindle strife.

22 The words of a gossiper are like dainty morsels, [.linebr]#/# +
and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.

23 Burning lips and a wicked heart [.linebr]#/# +
are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.

24 He who hates dissembles with his lips [.linebr]#/# +
and lays up deceit within him.

25 When he speaks fair, do not believe him, [.linebr]#/# +
for there are seven abominations in his heart.

26 His hatred is covered by deceit. [.linebr]#/# +
His wickedness shall be shown before the whole congregation.

27 Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who rolls a stone, it will return upon him.

28 A lying tongue hates those who are afflicted by it, [.linebr]#/# +
and a flattering mouth works ruin.

_Observations of self love, 1-4; of true love, 5-10; of care to avoid offenses, 11-22; and of the household care, 23-27._

1 Do not boast about tomorrow, [.linebr]#/# +
for you do not know what a day may bring forth.

2 Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth, [.linebr]#/# +
a stranger, and not your own lips.

3 A stone is heavy and the sand weighty, [.linebr]#/# +
but a fool's wrath is heavier than both.

4 Wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous, [.linebr]#/# +
but who is able to stand before envy?

5 Open rebuke is better [.linebr]#/# +
than secret love.

6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend, [.linebr]#/# +
but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.

7 The full soul loathes a honey-comb, [.linebr]#/# +
but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.

8 As a bird that wanders from her nest, [.linebr]#/# +
so is a man who wanders from his place.

9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, [.linebr]#/# +
and so does the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.

10 Your own friend and your father's friend, do not forsake, [.linebr]#/# +
neither go into your brother's house in the day of your calamity, [.linebr]#/# +
for better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far off.

11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, [.linebr]#/# +
so that I may answer him who reproaches me.

12 A prudent man foresees the evil and hides himself, [.linebr]#/# +
but the simple pass on and are punished.

13 Take his garment who is surety for a stranger, [.linebr]#/# +
and hold him in pledge for a strange woman.

14 He who blesses his friend with a loud voice, [.linebr]#/# +
rising early in the morning, [.linebr]#/# +
it shall be counted a curse to him.

15 A continual dropping on a very rainy day [.linebr]#/# +
and a contentious woman are alike.

16 Whoever hides her has hidden the wind [.linebr]#/# +
and has grasped ointment with his right hand.

17 As iron sharpens iron, [.linebr]#/# +
so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.

18 He who keeps the fig-tree shall eat its fruit, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who guards his master shall be honored.

19 As in water face reflects face, [.linebr]#/# +
so the heart of man to man.

20 Hell and destruction are never full, [.linebr]#/# +
and the eyes of man are never satisfied.

21 As the refining-pot for silver and the furnace for gold, [.linebr]#/# +
so is a man to his praise.

22 Though you should bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, [.linebr]#/# +
yet his foolishness will not depart from him.

23 Be diligent to know the state of your flocks, [.linebr]#/# +
and look well to your herds,

24 For riches are not forever— [.linebr]#/# +
and does the crown endure to every generation?

25 When the grass is removed, and the tender grass shows itself, [.linebr]#/# +
and herbs of the mountains are gathered,

26 The lambs will be for your clothing, [.linebr]#/# +
and the goats the price of a field.

27 And you shall have enough goats' milk for your food, [.linebr]#/# +
for the food of your household, [.linebr]#/# +
and for sustenance for your young women.

_General observations of impiety and religious integrity, 1-28._

1 The wicked flee when no man pursues, [.linebr]#/# +
but the righteous are as bold as a lion.

2 For the transgression of a land many are its princes, [.linebr]#/# +
but by a man of understanding and knowledge [.linebr]#/# +
the state thereof shall be prolonged.

3 A poor man who oppresses the poor [.linebr]#/# +
is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food.

4 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, [.linebr]#/# +
but those who keep the law contend with them.

5 Evil men do not understand judgment, [.linebr]#/# +
but those who seek the LORD understand all things.

6 Better is the poor who walks in his uprightness [.linebr]#/# +
than the rich who is perverse in his ways.

7 He who keeps the law is a wise son, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who is a companion of riotous men shames his father.

8 He who by usury and unjust gain increases his substance, [.linebr]#/# +
he shall gather it for him who will pity the poor.

9 He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, [.linebr]#/# +
even his prayer shall be an abomination.

10 Whoever causes the righteous to go astray in an evil way [.linebr]#/# +
shall fall himself into his own pit, [.linebr]#/# +
but the upright shall have good things in possession.

11 The rich man is wise in his own conceit, [.linebr]#/# +
but the poor man who has understanding searches him out.

12 When righteous men rejoice, there is great glory, [.linebr]#/# +
but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

13 He who covers his sins shall not prosper, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.

14 Happy is the man who fears always, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who hardens his heart shall fall into mischief.

15 As a roaring lion and a hungry bear, [.linebr]#/# +
so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.

16 The prince who lacks understanding is also a great oppressor, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who hates covetousness shall prolong his days.

17 A man who does violence to the blood of any person [.linebr]#/# +
shall flee to the pit. Let no man stay him.

18 He who walks uprightly shall be saved, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.

19 He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who follows after vain persons shall be filled with poverty.

20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

21 To have respect of persons is not good, [.linebr]#/# +
because for a piece of bread a man will transgress.

22 He who hastens to be rich has an evil eye [.linebr]#/# +
and does not consider that poverty shall come upon him.

23 He who rebukes a man afterward shall find more favor [.linebr]#/# +
than he who flatters with the tongue.

24 He who robs his father or his mother, [.linebr]#/# +
and says, "It is no transgression," [.linebr]#/# +
the same is the companion of a destroyer.

25 He who is of a proud heart stirs up strife, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who puts his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

26 He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, [.linebr]#/# +
but whoever walks wisely, he shall be delivered.

27 He who gives to the poor shall lack nothing, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who hides his eyes shall have many curses.

28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves, [.linebr]#/# +
but when they perish, the righteous increase.

_Observations of public government, 1-14, and of private, 15-21. Of anger, pride, thievery, cowardice, and corruption, 22-27._

1 He who is often reproved and hardens his neck [.linebr]#/# +
shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.

2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice, [.linebr]#/# +
but when the wicked bears rule, the people mourn.

3 He who loves wisdom makes his father glad, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who keeps company with harlots spends his substance.

4 The king by judgment establishes the land, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who receives gifts overthrows it.

5 A man who flatters his neighbor [.linebr]#/# +
spreads a net for his feet.

6 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare, [.linebr]#/# +
but the righteous sings and rejoices.

7 The righteous considers the cause of the poor, [.linebr]#/# +
but the wicked does not regard to know it.

8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare, [.linebr]#/# +
but wise men turn away wrath.

9 If a wise man contends with a foolish man, [.linebr]#/# +
whether he rages or laughs, there is no rest.

10 The blood-thirsty hate the upright, [.linebr]#/# +
but the just seek his soul.

11 A fool utters all his mind, [.linebr]#/# +
but a wise man keeps it in until afterward.

12 If a ruler listens to lies, [.linebr]#/# +
all his servants are wicked.

13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together, [.linebr]#/# +
the LORD enlightens both their eyes.

14 The king who faithfully judges the poor, [.linebr]#/# +
his throne shall be established forever.

15 The rod and reproof give wisdom, [.linebr]#/# +
but a child left to himself brings his mother to shame.

16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increases, [.linebr]#/# +
but the righteous shall see their fall.

17 Correct your son and he shall give you rest. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall even give delight to your soul.

18 Where there is no vision, the people perish, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who keeps the law is happy.

19 A servant will not be corrected by words, [.linebr]#/# +
for though he understands, he will not answer.

20 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? [.linebr]#/# +
There is more hope for a fool than for him.

21 He who delicately brings up his servant from a child [.linebr]#/# +
shall have him at length become his son.

22 An angry man stirs up strife, [.linebr]#/# +
and a furious man abounds in transgression.

23 A man's pride shall bring him low, [.linebr]#/# +
but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit.

24 Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own soul. [.linebr]#/# +
He hears cursing and does not disclose it.

25 The fear of man brings a snare, [.linebr]#/# +
but he who puts his trust in the LORD shall be safe.

26 Many seek the ruler's favor, [.linebr]#/# +
but every man's judgment comes from the LORD.

27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.

Parents are not to be despised, 17. Four things hard to be known, 18-20. Four things intolerable. 21-23. Four things exceedingly wise, 24-28. Four things stately, 29-31. Wrath is to be prevented, 32, 33._

1 [_The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy. The man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal._]

2 Surely I am more brutish than any man [.linebr]#/# +
and do not have the understanding of a man.

3 I neither learned wisdom, [.linebr]#/# +
nor have the knowledge of the Holy One.

4 Who has ascended into heaven and descended? [.linebr]#/# +
Who has gathered the wind in his fists? [.linebr]#/# +
Who has bound the waters in a garment? [.linebr]#/# +
Who has established all the ends of the earth? [.linebr]#/# +
What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you can tell?

5 Every word of God is pure. [.linebr]#/# +
He is a shield to those who put their trust in him.

6 Do not add to his words, [.linebr]#/# +
lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.

7 Two things I have required of you, [.linebr]#/# +
do not deny them to me before I die:

8 Keep vanity and lies far from me, [.linebr]#/# +
and give me neither poverty nor riches. [.linebr]#/# +
Feed me with the food of my portion,

9 Lest I be full and deny you, and say, "Who is the LORD?" [.linebr]#/# +
or lest I be poor and steal [.linebr]#/# +
and take the name of my God in vain.

10 Do not accuse a servant to his master, [.linebr]#/# +
lest he curse you and you be found guilty.

11 There is a generation that curses their father [.linebr]#/# +
and does not bless their mother.

12 There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes, [.linebr]#/# +
but are not washed from their filthiness.

13 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! [.linebr]#/# +
And their eyelids are lifted up.

14 There is a generation whose teeth are like swords [.linebr]#/# +
and their jaw-teeth are like knives [.linebr]#/# +
to devour the poor from off the earth [.linebr]#/# +
and the needy from among men.

15 The horse-leech has two daughters, crying, "Give, give." [.linebr]#/# +
There are three things that are never satisfied, [.linebr]#/# +
even four things that do not say, "It is enough":

16 The grave, the barren womb, [.linebr]#/# +
the earth that is not filled with water, [.linebr]#/# +
and the fire that does not say, "It is enough."

17 The eye that mocks at its father [.linebr]#/# +
and despises to obey its mother, [.linebr]#/# +
the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, [.linebr]#/# +
and the young eagles shall eat it.

18 There are three things which are too wonderful for me, [.linebr]#/# +
even four which I do not know:

19 The way of an eagle in the air, [.linebr]#/# +
the way of a serpent upon a rock, [.linebr]#/# +
the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, [.linebr]#/# +
and the way of a man with a young woman.

20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman: [.linebr]#/# +
she eats and wipes her mouth, [.linebr]#/# +
and says, "I have done no wickedness."

21 For three things the earth is disquieted, [.linebr]#/# +
even for four which it cannot bear:

22 A servant when he reigns, [.linebr]#/# +
a fool when he is filled with food,

23 An odious woman when she is married, [.linebr]#/# +
and a woman-servant who is heir to her mistress.

24 There are four things which are little upon the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
but they are very wise:

25 The ants are a people not strong, [.linebr]#/# +
yet they prepare their food in the summer,

26 The conies are but a feeble people, [.linebr]#/# +
yet they make their houses in the rocks,

27 The locusts have no king, [.linebr]#/# +
yet all of them go forth by bands,

28 The spider takes hold with her hands [.linebr]#/# +
and is in kings' palaces.

29 There are three things which go well, [.linebr]#/# +
even four are stately in going:

30 A lion, which is strongest among beasts [.linebr]#/# +
and does not turn away for any,

31 A greyhound, a male goat, [.linebr]#/# +
and a king, against whom there is no rising up.

32 If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself [.linebr]#/# +
or if you have thought evil, [.linebr]#/# +
lay your hand upon your mouth.

33 Surely the churning of milk brings forth butter, [.linebr]#/# +
and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood, [.linebr]#/# +
and the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.
