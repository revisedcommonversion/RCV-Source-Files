== The Letter from James

*James | Ιακώβου*

[#jms001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_We are to rejoice under the cross, 1-4; to ask patience of God, 5-12; and in our trials not to impute our weakness or sins to him, 13-18, but rather to listen to the word, meditate on it, and be doers of it, 19-25. Otherwise, men may only seem, but never be, truly religious, 26, 27._

1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings.

2 My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations, 3 Knowing that the trying of your faith works patience. 4 But let patience have her perfect work so that you may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing.

5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives to all men liberally and without reproach, and it shall be given to him. 6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he who wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 7 For let that man not think that he shall receive anything from the Lord. 8 A man unsettled in his opinions is unstable in all his ways.

9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted, 10 And the rich in that he is made low because he shall pass away as a flower of the grass. 11 For the sun arose with its burning heat and withered the grass. Its flower fell and the grace of its fashion perished. Likewise also, the rich man shall fade away in his ways.

12 Blessed is the man who endures temptation. For when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him. 13 Let no man say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God," for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither does he tempt any man. 14 But every man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. 15 Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin. And sin, when it is finished, brings forth death. 16 Do not err, my beloved brothers. 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. 18 Of his own will he has begotten us with the word of truth so that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.

19 Therefore, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath, 20 For the wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God. 21 Therefore, lay apart all filthiness and overflow of wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 22 But be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. 23 For if any is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror. 24 For he beholds himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was. 25 But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, not being a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

26 If any man among you seems to be religious and does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain. 27 Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_It is not agreeable to Christian profession to regard the rich and despise the poor brothers, 1-12; rather we are to be loving and merciful, 13; and not to boast of faith where no deeds are, 14-16; which is but a dead faith, 17, 18; the faith of devils, 19, 20; not of Abraham, 21-24; nor Rahab, 25, 26._

1 My brothers, do not have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. 2 For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and in fine apparel, and also a poor man in vile clothing comes in, 3 And you have respect to him who wears the fine clothing and say to him, "Sit here in a good place," and say to the poor, "Stand there," or, "Sit here under my footstool," 4 Are you not then partial in yourselves and have become judges with evil thoughts? 5 Listen, my beloved brothers. Has God not chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him? 6 But you have despised the poor. Do rich men not oppress you and draw you before the judgment-seats? 7 Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by which you are called?

[[jms002-008]]8 If you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "_You shall love your neighbor as yourself,_" you do well. 9 But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. [[jms002-010]]10 For whoever keeps the whole law and yet offends in one point, he is guilty of all. [[jms002-011]]11 For he who said, "_Do not commit adultery,_" also said, "_Do not kill._" Now if you commit no adultery, yet if you kill, you have become a transgressor of the law. 12 Speak in such a manner and do in such a manner as those who are judged by the law of liberty. 13 For he shall have judgment without mercy who has shown no mercy. And mercy rejoices against judgment.

14 What does it profit, my brothers, if a man says he has faith and does not have works? Can faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, 16 And one of you says to them, "Depart in peace, be warmed and filled," and you do not give them those things which are needful to the body, what does it profit? 17 Likewise faith, if it does not have works, is dead, being alone.

18 Also a man may say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works. 19 You believe that there is one God. You do well. The demons also believe, and tremble. 20 But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 21 Was Abraham our father not justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 22 Do you see how faith wrought with his works, and faith was made perfect by works? [[jms002-023]]23 And the Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "_Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness,_" and he was called the Friend of God. 24 You see then that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 25 Likewise also, was Rahab the harlot not justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way? 26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_We are not rashly or arrogantly to reprove others, 1-4; but rather to bridle the tongue, a little member, but a powerful instrument of much good and great harm, 5-12. Those who are truly wise are mild and peaceable without envying and strife, 13-18._

1 My brothers, do not become many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. 2 For in many things we all offend. If any man does not offend in word, the same is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body. 3 Behold, we put bits in the mouths of horses so that they may obey us, and we direct their whole body. 4 Behold also the ships: though they are so great and are driven by fierce winds, yet they are directed with a very small helm, wherever the helmsman wills. 5 Likewise, the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles! 6 And the tongue, that world of iniquity, is a fire. The tongue is set in our members as that which defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of nature, and it is set on fire from hell. 7 For every kind, both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and of animals in the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind. 8 But no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. 9 With this we bless God, even the Father, and with this we curse men, who are made after the similitude of God. 10 Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. 11 Does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet and bitter water? 12 Can the fig-tree, my brothers, bear olive-berries, or a vine, figs? In the same manner no fountain can yield both salt and fresh water.

13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? Let him show by a good deportment his works with meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, do not glory and do not lie against the truth. 15 This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demoniacal. 16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. 17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

=== Chapter 4

[.outline.text-center]
_We are to strive against covetousness, 1-3; intemperance, 4; pride, 5-10; and slander and rash judgment of others, 11, 12. We are not to be confident in the good success of worldly business, but rather always be mindful of the uncertainty of this life, and to commit ourselves and all our affairs to God's providence, 13-17._

1 Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Do they not come from here, even from your lusts that war in your members? 2 You lust and do not have. You kill and desire to have and cannot obtain. You fight and war. You do not have because you do not ask. 3 You ask and do not receive because you ask with bad intent, so that you may spend it in your pleasures. 4 You adulterers and adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. 5 Do you think that the Scripture says in vain, "The spirit which dwells in us earnestly desires to envy"? [[jms004-006]]6 But he gives more grace. Therefore, he says, "_God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble._" 7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. 8 Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 9 Be afflicted, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness. 10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he will lift you up.

11 Do not speak evil of one another, brothers. He who speaks evil of his brother and judges his brother speaks evil of the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge. 12 Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another?

13 Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into this city and spend a year there, and trade and make gain." 14 You do not know what will be on the next day. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. 15 Instead of that, you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that." 16 But now you rejoice in your boastings. All such rejoicing is evil. 17 Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_Wicked rich men are to fear God's vengeance, 1-6. We ought to be patient in afflictions after the example of the prophets and Job, 7-11; to forbear swearing, 12; to pray in adversity, to sing in prosperity, 13; to acknowledge mutually our many sins, to pray for one another, 14-18; and to restore a straying brother to the truth, 19, 20._

1 Come now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. 2 Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten. 3 Your gold and silver is cankered, and their rust shall be a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire. You have amassed treasure for the last days. [[jms005-004]]4 Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped your fields, which is by you kept back by fraud, cries. And the cries of those who have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. [[jms005-005]]5 You have lived luxuriously and in pleasure on the earth. You have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter. 6 You have condemned and killed the just, and he does not resist you.

7 Be patient, therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it until it receives the early and the latter rain. 8 Be also patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws near. 9 Do not grudge against one another, brothers, lest you be condemned. Behold, the judge stands before the door. 10 My brothers, take the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience. 11 Behold, we count those happy who endure. You have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the outcome from the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and full of tender mercy.

12 But above all things, my brothers, do not swear, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath. But let your "Yes," be "Yes," and your "No," "No," lest you fall into condemnation.

13 Is anyone among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing psalms. 14 Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. 16 Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man avails much. 17 Elijah was a man subject to similar passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months. 18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth its fruit.

19 Brothers, if any one of you should err from the truth, and someone should convert him, 20 Let him know, that he who converts a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will hide a multitude of sins.
