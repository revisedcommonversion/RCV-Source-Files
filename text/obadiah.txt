== The Vision of Obadiah

*Obadiah | Ὀβδιού | עובדיה*

[#oba001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_The destruction of Edom, 1, 2, for their pride, 3-9, and for their wrong to Jacob, 10-16. The salvation and victory of Jacob, 17-21._

1 [_The vision of Obadiah._] Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom—we have heard a rumor from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, saying, "Arise, and let us rise up against her in battle"—

|2 "Behold, I have made you small among the heathen. [.linebr]#/# +
You are greatly despised.

|
|3 The pride of your heart has deceived you, [.linebr]#/# +
you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, [.linebr]#/# +
whose habitation is high, [.linebr]#/# +
who says in his heart, [.linebr]#/# +
'Who shall bring me down to the ground?'

|
|4 Though you exalt yourself as the eagle [.linebr]#/# +
and though you set your nest among the stars, [.linebr]#/# +
from there I will bring you down,"
|===

says the LORD.

|5 "If thieves came to you, if robbers by night [.linebr]#/# +
(O how you are cut off!), [.linebr]#/# +
would they not have stolen until they had enough? [.linebr]#/# +
If the grape-gatherers came to you, [.linebr]#/# +
would they not leave some grapes?

|
|6 How the things of Esau are searched out! [.linebr]#/# +
How his hidden things are sought!

|
|7 All the men of your confederacy [.linebr]#/# +
have brought you even to the border. [.linebr]#/# +
The men who were at peace with you [.linebr]#/# +
have deceived you and prevailed against you. [.linebr]#/# +
Those who eat your bread [.linebr]#/# +
have laid a wound under you. [.linebr]#/# +
There is no understanding in him.

|
|8 Shall I not in that day,"
|===

says the LORD,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|
|"even destroy the wise men out of Edom [.linebr]#/# +
and understanding out of the mountain of Esau?

|
|9 And your mighty men, O Teman, [.linebr]#/# +
shall be dismayed, [.linebr]#/# +
to the end that everyone of the mountain of Esau [.linebr]#/# +
may be cut off by slaughter.

|
|10 "For your violence against your brother Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
shame shall cover you, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall be cut off forever.

|
|11 In the day that you stood on the other side, [.linebr]#/# +
in the day that the strangers carried away his forces captive [.linebr]#/# +
and foreigners entered into his gates [.linebr]#/# +
and cast lots upon Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
even you were as one of them.

|
|12 But you should not have looked in the day of your brother, [.linebr]#/# +
in the day that he became a stranger, [.linebr]#/# +
neither should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah [.linebr]#/# +
in the day of their destruction, [.linebr]#/# +
neither should you have spoken proudly [.linebr]#/# +
in the day of distress.

|
|13 You should not have entered into the gate of my people [.linebr]#/# +
in the day of their calamity. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, you should not have looked upon their affliction [.linebr]#/# +
in the day of their calamity, [.linebr]#/# +
nor have laid hands on their substance [.linebr]#/# +
in the day of their calamity,

|
|14 Neither should you have stood in the cross-way [.linebr]#/# +
to cut off those of his who escaped, [.linebr]#/# +
neither should you have delivered up those of his who remained [.linebr]#/# +
in the day of distress.

|
|15 "For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen. [.linebr]#/# +
As you have done, it shall be done to you. [.linebr]#/# +
Your reward shall return upon your own head.

|
|16 For as you have drank upon my holy mountain, [.linebr]#/# +
so all the heathen shall drink continually. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, they shall drink and they shall swallow down, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall be as though they had not been.

|
|17 But upon mount Zion there shall be deliverance [.linebr]#/# +
and there shall be holiness. [.linebr]#/# +
And the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.

|
|18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, [.linebr]#/# +
the house of Joseph a flame, [.linebr]#/# +
and the house of Esau for stubble, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall kindle in them and devour them. [.linebr]#/# +
And there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau."
|===

For the LORD has spoken it.

|
|19 And those of the south shall possess the mountain of Esau, [.linebr]#/# +
and those of the plain, the Philistines. [.linebr]#/# +
And they shall possess the fields of Ephraim [.linebr]#/# +
and the fields of Samaria. [.linebr]#/# +
And Benjamin shall possess Gilead.

|
|20 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel [.linebr]#/# +
shall possess that of the Canaanites, even to Zarephath. [.linebr]#/# +
And the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, [.linebr]#/# +
shall possess the cities of the south.

|
|21 And saviors shall come upon mount Zion [.linebr]#/# +
to judge the mountain of Esau, [.linebr]#/# +
and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S.
