_The church's love for Christ, 1-4. She confesses her deformity, 5, 6, and prays to be directed to his flock, 7. Christ directs her to the shepherds' tents, 8; and showing his love to her, 9, 10, gives her gracious promises, 11. The church and Christ congratulate one another, 12-17._

because the sun has looked upon me. [.linebr]#/# +
My mother's children were angry with me. [.linebr]#/# +
They made me the keeper of the vineyards, [.linebr]#/# +
but I have not kept my own vineyard.

For why should I be as one who turns aside [.linebr]#/# +

I sought him, but I did not find him.

but I found him whom my soul loves. [.linebr]#/# +
I held him and would not let him go [.linebr]#/# +
until I had brought him into my mother's house [.linebr]#/# +

Sixty valiant men are around it, [.linebr]#/# +

Every man has his sword upon his thigh [.linebr]#/# +
because of fear in the night.
