=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_God creates heaven and earth, 1; the light, 3; the firmament, 6; separates the dry land, 9; forms the sun, moon, and stars, 14; fish and birds, 20; livestock, wild beasts, and creeping things, 24; creates man in his own image, blesses him, 26; grants the fruits of the earth for food, 29._

1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 3 And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good, and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 And God called the light "day," and he called the darkness "night," and the evening and the morning were the first day.

6 And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters." 7 And God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. 8 And God called the firmament "heaven." And the evening and the morning were the second day.

9 And God said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so. 10 And God called the dry land "earth," and he called the collection of waters "seas." And God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth." And it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind. And God saw that it was good. 13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night, and let them be for signs, for seasons, for days, and years. 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth." And it was so. 16 And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 To rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

20 And God said, "Let the waters abundantly bring forth the moving creature that has life and the bird that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven." 21 And God created the great sea-creatures and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth." 23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

24 And God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind: livestock, the creeping animal, and the beast of the earth after its kind." And it was so. 25 And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, livestock after their kind, and every animal that creeps upon the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good.

26 And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over every creeping animal that creeps upon the earth."

28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, replenish the earth, and subdue it. And have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the bird of the air, and over every living animal that moves upon the earth." 29 And God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed. To you it shall be for food. 30 And to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to every animal that creeps upon the earth, in which is life, I have given every green herb for food." And it was so. 31 And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_The first Sabbath, 1-3. Further particulars concerning the manner of creation, 4-7. The planting of the garden of Eden and its situation, 8-14; man is placed in it; and the tree of knowledge only forbidden, 15-17. The animals are named by Adam, 18. The making of woman and the institution of marriage, 21-25._

1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. [[gen002-002]]2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made. And he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3 And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens. 5 And no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet grown, because the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth and there was not a man to till the ground. 6 But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground. [[gen002-007]]7 And the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. And man became a living soul. 8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9 And out of the ground the LORD God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, and also the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden. And from there it was parted and became into four heads. 11 The name of the first is Pison, which compasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. 12 And the gold of that land is good. There is bdellium and the onyx-stone. 13 And the name of the second river is Gihon, the same that compasses the whole land of Cush. 14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel, which flows toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

15 And the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "From every tree of the garden you may freely eat. 17 But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat from it. For in the day that you eat from it you shall surely die."

18 And the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a helper suitable for him." 19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called every living creature, that was its name. 20 And Adam gave names to all livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam, a helper suitable for him was not found. 21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place. 22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from the man, he made into a woman, and brought her to the man. 23 And Adam said,

[.outline.text-center]
_The serpent deceives Eve, 1-5. Both she and Adam transgress the divine command and fall into sin and misery, 6, 7. God arraigns them, 8-13. The serpent is cursed, 14. The promised offspring, 15. The punishment of mankind, 16-20. Their first clothing, 21. Their expulsion from paradise, 22-24._

1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made, and he said to the woman, "Has God truly said, 'You shall not eat from every tree of the garden'?" 2 And the woman said to the serpent, "We may eat the fruit from the trees of the garden, 3 But concerning the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat from it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'" 4 And the serpent said to the woman, "You shall not surely die. 5 For God knows, that in the day you eat from it, your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate, and gave some also to her husband with her, and he ate. 7 And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig-leaves together and made coverings for themselves.

8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 9 And the LORD God called to Adam and said to him, "Where are you?" 10 And he said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself." 11 And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?" 12 And the man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me some from the tree, and I ate." 13 And the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" And the woman said, "The serpent beguiled me, and I ate."

14 And the LORD God said to the serpent,

20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living. 21 For Adam and also for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins and clothed them.

22 And the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he should put forth his hand and take from the tree of life and eat and live forever—" 23 Therefore, the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken. [[gen003-024]]24 So he drove out the man, and he placed Cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life.

_The birth, occupation, and offering of Cain and Abel, 1-7. Cain murders his brother Abel, 8-10. The curse of Cain, 11-16. He has a son named Enoch and builds a city, which he calls after his name, 17. His descendants, with Lamech and his two wives, 18-24. The birth of Seth, 25, and Enos, 26._

1 And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, "I have gotten a man from the LORD." 2 And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought from the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD. 4 And Abel, he also brought some of the first-born of his flock and some of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect for Abel and for his offering, 5 But for Cain and for his offering he did not have respect. And Cain was very angry and his countenance fell. 6 And the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? 7 If you do well, shall you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire shall be for you, and you must rule over it." 8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother. And it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.

9 And the LORD said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?" 10 And he said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground. 11 And now you are cursed from the earth which has opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 12 When you till the ground, it shall not from now on yield to you its strength. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be in the earth." 13 And Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14 Behold, you have driven me this day from the face of the earth, and from your face I shall be hid. And I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth. And it will come to pass, that everyone who finds me will slay me." 15 And the LORD said to him, "Therefore, whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold." And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him.

16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

17 And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch. 18 And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methusael, and Methusael begot Lamech. 19 And Lamech took for himself two wives: the name of one was Adah and the name of the other Zillah. 20 And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents and of those who have livestock. 21 And his brother's name was Jubal. He was the father of all those who handle the harp and pipe. 22 And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, a forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.

23 And Lamech said to his wives,

25 And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, "God has appointed me another child instead of Abel, whom Cain slew." 26 And to Seth, to him there was also born a son, and he called his name Enos. Then men began to call upon the name of the LORD.

_The wickedness of the world, which provoked God's wrath and caused the flood, 1-7. Noah finds grace, 8. His generations, etc., 9-13. The order, form, dimensions, and completion of the ark, 14-22._

1 And it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born to them, 2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair. And they took for themselves wives from all whom they chose. 3 And the LORD said, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man, because he is flesh; therefore, his days shall be one hundred and twenty years." 4 There were Nephilim in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them. The same became mighty men who were of old, men of renown.

5 And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 And the LORD repented that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart. 7 And the LORD said, "I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth—man, beast, the creeping animal, and the birds of the air. For I repent that I have made them." 8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

9 These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. 10 And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

11 The earth was also corrupt before God. And the earth was filled with violence. 12 And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

13 And God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 14 Make yourself an ark of gopher-wood. You shall make rooms in the ark and shall pitch it inside and outside with pitch. 15 And this is the fashion in which you shall make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. 16 You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. And the door of the ark you shall set in its side. With lower, second, and third stories you shall make it. 17 And behold, I, even I bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh, in which is the breath of life, from under heaven. And everything that is on the earth shall die. 18 But with you I will establish my covenant. And you shall come into the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you. 19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort you shall bring into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. 20 Of birds after their kind, of livestock after their kind, and of every creeping animal of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come to you to keep them alive. 21 And take for yourself some of all food that is eaten, and you shall gather it for yourself, and it shall be food for you and for them." 22 And Noah did so. According to all that God commanded him, so he did.

_Noah, with his family and the living creatures, enters the ark, and the flood begins, 1-16. The increase and continuance of the flood for forty days, 17-20. All flesh is destroyed by it, 21-23. Its duration, 24._

1 And the LORD said to Noah, "Come—you and all your house—into the ark. For I have seen you righteous before me in this generation. 2 Of every clean beast you shall take with you by sevens, the male and his female, and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female, 3 Of birds of the air also by sevens, the male and the female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth. 4 For after seven more days, I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights. And every living substance that I have made I will destroy from the face of the earth." 5 And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.

6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth. 7 And Noah went in, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 8 Of clean beasts, of beasts that are not clean, of birds, and of every animal that creeps upon the earth, 9 There went in two and two with Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. 10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. 11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the same day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up and the windows of heaven were opened. 12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

13 In the same day Noah, along with Shem, Ham, and Japheth (the sons of Noah), Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ark— 14 They, every beast after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping animal that creeps upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort. 15 And they went in with Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which is the breath of life. 16 And those that entered went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him. And the LORD shut him in.

17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth. And the waters increased and bore up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth. 18 And the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark moved upon the face of the waters. 19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered. 20 Fifteen cubits upward the waters prevailed, and the mountains were covered. 21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, of bird, of livestock, of beast, of every creeping animal that creeps upon the earth, and every man. 22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was on the dry land, died. 23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground—man, livestock, the creeping animals, and the bird of heaven—and they were destroyed from the earth. And only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive. 24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.

_God remembers Noah and assuages the waters, 1-3. The ark rests on Ararat, 4, 5. Noah sends forth a raven and then a dove, 6-12. Noah, being commanded, goes forth from the ark, 13-19. He builds an altar and offers sacrifice, which God accepts and promises to curse the earth no more, 20-22._

1 And God remembered Noah and every living animal and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were checked. 2 Also the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained, 3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually. And after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. 4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.

6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. 7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried from off the earth. 8 He also sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground, 9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned to him into the ark, because the waters were on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand, took her, and brought her to himself into the ark. 10 And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. 11 And the dove returned to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was an olive-leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12 And he waited yet another seven days and sent forth the dove, which did not return again to him anymore.

13 And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry. 14 And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried. 15 And God spoke to Noah, saying, 16 "Go forth from the ark—you, your wife, your sons, and your sons' wives with you. 17 Bring forth with you every living animal that is with you of all flesh, of bird, of livestock, and of every creeping animal that creeps upon the earth, so that they may breed abundantly on the earth, be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth." 18 And Noah went forth, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him. 19 Every beast, every creeping animal, every bird, and whatever creeps upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark.

20 And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took some of every clean beast and some of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. 21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savor, and the LORD said in his heart, "I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth, neither will I ever again smite every living animal as I have done.

Into your hand they are delivered. 3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. Even as the green herb, I have given you all things. 4 But flesh with its life, which is its blood, you shall not eat. 5 And surely for your blood of your lives I will require [an accounting].

8 And God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 9 "And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you and with your posterity after you, 10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the bird, of the livestock, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off anymore by the waters of a flood, neither shall there anymore be a flood to destroy the earth." 12 And God said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations: 13 I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 14 And it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud, 15 And I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it so that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth." 17 And God said to Noah, "This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."

18 And the sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan. 19 These three were the sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was populated.

20 And Noah began to be a farmer and he planted a vineyard. 21 And he drank the wine and was drunken and uncovered within his tent. 22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside. 23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it upon both their shoulders, went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backward and they did not see their father's nakedness. 24 And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done to him. 25 And he said,

_The generations of Noah, 1. Japheth, 2-5. Ham, 6, 7. Nimrod the first monarch and the descendants of Canaan, 8-20. The sons of Shem, 21-32._

1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And to them sons were born after the flood.

2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 3 And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 4 And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 5 By these the islands of the Gentiles were divided in their lands, each after his language, after their families, in their nations.

6 And the sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan. 7 And the sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtecha. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 8 And Cush begot Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one on the earth. 9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore, it is said, "Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD." 10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 11 Out of that land Ashur went forth and built Nineveh, the city Rehoboth, Calah, 12 And Resen, between Nineveh and Calah—the same is a great city. 13 And Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 14 Pathrusim, Casluhim (out of whom came Philistim), and Caphtorim.

15 And Canaan begot Sidon his first-born, Heth, 16 The Jebusite, the Emorite, the Girgasite, 17 The Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite, 18 The Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. And afterward, the families of the Canaanites were dispersed. 19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as far as to Gerar, to Gaza, as far as to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lashah. 20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their languages, in their countries, and in their nations.

21 To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him children were born. 22 The children of Shem: Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. 23 And the children of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 24 And Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber. 25 And to Eber two sons were born: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan. 26 And Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as far as to Sephar, a mountain of the east. 31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, after their nations.

32 These are the families of the sons of Noah after their generations, in their nations. And by these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood.

1 And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 2 And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they dwelt there. 3 And they said to one another, "Come, let us make brick and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone and they had slime for mortar. 4 And they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven. And let us make ourselves a name, lest we should be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth." 5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men were building. 6 And the LORD said, "Behold, the people are one and they all have one language. And this they begin to do, and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have purposed to do. 7 Come, let us go down and there confound their language so that they may not understand one another's speech." 8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from there upon the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. 9 Therefore, its name is called Babel, because there the LORD confounded the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

10 These are the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood. 11 And Shem lived after he begot Arphaxad five hundred years and begot sons and daughters.

12 And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years and begot Salah. 13 And Arphaxad lived after he begot Salah four hundred and three years and begot sons and daughters.

14 And Salah lived thirty years and begot Eber. 15 And Salah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years and begot sons and daughters.

16 And Eber lived thirty-four years and begot Peleg. 17 And Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years and begot sons and daughters.

18 And Peleg lived thirty years and begot Reu. 19 And Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years and begot sons and daughters.

20 And Reu lived thirty-two years and begot Serug. 21 And Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years and begot sons and daughters.

22 And Serug lived thirty years and begot Nahor. 23 And Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years and begot sons and daughters.

24 And Nahor lived twenty-nine years and begot Terah. 25 And Nahor lived after he begot Terah one hundred and nineteen years and begot sons and daughters.

26 And Terah lived seventy years and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

27 Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begot Lot. 28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 29 And Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah. 30 But Sarai was barren. She had no child.

31 And Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan. And they came to Haran and dwelt there. 32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.

[[gen012-001]]1 Now the LORD had said to Abram, "Depart from your country, from your kindred, and from your father's house to a land that I will show you.

[[gen012-003]]3 And I will bless those who bless you and curse him who curses you. And in you all families of the earth shall be blessed."

4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. 5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother's son, all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran, and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan. And into the land of Canaan they came. 6 And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. [[gen012-007]]7 And the LORD appeared to Abram and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." And there he erected an altar to the LORD who appeared to him. 8 And he departed from there to a mountain on the east of Beth-el and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west and Hai on the east. And there he erected an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD. 9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

10 And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there, for the famine was grievous in the land. 11 And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, "Behold now, I know that you are a fair woman to look upon; 12 Therefore, it will come to pass, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, 'This is his wife,' and they will kill me, but they will save you alive. 13 Say, I pray you, you are my sister so that it may be well with me for your sake, and my soul shall live because of you." 14 And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. 15 The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her before Pharaoh, and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 16 And he treated Abram well for her sake, and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, men-servants, women-servants, female donkeys, and camels.

17 And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram's wife. 18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she is your wife? 19 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, behold your wife, take her and go your way." 20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him. And they sent him away, along with his wife and all that he had.

1 And Abram returned from Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into the south.

2 And Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. 3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai, 4 To the place of the altar which he had made there at the first. And there Abram called on the name of the LORD. 5 And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents. 6 And the land was not able to bear them so that they might dwell together, for their substance was so great that they could not dwell together. 7 And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.

8 And Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife, I pray you, between you and me and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers. 9 Is the whole land not before you? Separate yourself, I pray you, from me. If you will take the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you will depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left." 10 And Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah), even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as far as to Zoar. 11 Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan and Lot journeyed east. And they separated themselves from one another. 12 Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom. 13 But the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners before the LORD.

14 And the LORD said to Abram after Lot was separated from him, "Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are northward, southward, eastward, and westward. 15 All the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your offspring forever. 16 And I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your offspring shall also be numbered. 17 Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its breadth, for I will give it to you." 18 Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built an altar there to the LORD.

1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations, 2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 3 All these were joined together in the valley of Siddim, which is the Salt Sea. 4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 5 And in the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzims in Ham, the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 6 And the Horites in the mountains of Seir, to El-paran, which is by the wilderness. 7 And they returned and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites and also the Amorites, who dwelt in Hazezontamar. 8 And the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar) went out, and they joined battle with them in the valley of Siddim, 9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, Tidal king of nations, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five. 10 And the valley of Siddim was full of slime-pits. And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there. And those who remained fled to the mountain. 11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their provisions and went their way. 12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

13 And someone who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. For he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, and these were confederates with Abram. 14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan. 15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smote them and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 16 And he brought back all the goods. He also brought back his brother Lot and his goods, and also the women and the people.

17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale. 18 And Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine.

12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and behold, a horror of great darkness fell upon him. [[gen015-013]]13 And he said to Abram, "Know certainly that your offspring shall be strangers in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years.

17 And it came to pass, that when the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.

18 On that same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your offspring I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates River, 19 The land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 20 The Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaims, 21 The Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."

_God renews the covenant with Abram and changes his name to Abraham, in token of a greater blessing, 1-8. Circumcision is instituted, 9-14. Sarai's name is changed to Sarah and she is blessed, 15, 16. Isaac is promised and the time of his birth fixed, 17-22. Abraham and Ishmael are circumcised, 23-27._

1 And when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am the Almighty God. Walk before me and be perfect.

2 And I will make my covenant between me and you and will multiply you exceedingly."

3 And Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying,

4 "As for me, behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations.

[[gen017-005]]5 Your name shall no longer be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, because a father of many nations I have made you.

6 And I will make you exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of you, and kings shall proceed from you. [[gen017-007]]7 And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your offspring after you. [[gen017-008]]8 And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land in which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. And I will be their God."

9 And God said to Abraham, "You shall keep my covenant therefore—you and your offspring after you in their generations. 10 This is my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you, which you shall keep: every male child among you shall be circumcised. 11 And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you. 12 And he who is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male child in your generations—he who is born in the house or bought with money from any stranger who is not of your offspring. 13 He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised. And my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 14 And the uncircumcised male child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant."

15 And God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. 16 And I will bless her and give you a son also by her. I will even bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations. Kings of people shall proceed from her." 17 Then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart, "Shall a child be born to him who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?" 18 And Abraham said to God, "O that Ishmael might live before you!" 19 And God said, "Sarah your wife shall bear you a son indeed, and you shall call his name Isaac. And I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his offspring after him. 20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. 21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time in the next year." 22 And he ceased talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin, in the same day, as God had said to him. 24 And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 26 In the same day Abraham and Ishmael his son were circumcised. 27 And all the men of his house, born in the house and bought with money from the stranger, were circumcised with him.

1 And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day. 2 And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men stood by him. And when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground, 3 And said, "My Lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, I pray you, do not pass your servant by. 4 Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree, 5 And I will bring a morsel of bread, and you may comfort your hearts. After that, you may go your way, for therefore you have come to your servant." And they said, "Do so, as you have said." 6 And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah and said, "Quickly make ready three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth." 7 And Abraham ran to the herd, brought a calf tender and good, and gave it to a young man, and he hastened to dress it. 8 And he took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them, and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.

9 And they said to him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" And he said, "Behold, in the tent." [[gen018-010]]10 And he said, "I will certainly return to you according to the time of life, and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son." And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. 11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and far advanced in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. 12 Therefore, Sarah laughed within herself, saying, "After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?" 13 And the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?' 14 Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son." 15 Then Sarah denied, saying, "I did not laugh," for she was afraid. And he said, "No, but you did laugh."

16 And the men rose up from there and looked toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 17 And the LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do, 18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they will keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him." 20 And the LORD said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous, 21 I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to its cry which has come to me, and if not, I will know."

22 And the men turned their faces from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the LORD. 23 And Abraham drew near and said, "Will you also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 24 Perhaps there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it? 25 That is far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked. That is far from you. Shall the Judge of all the earth not do right?" 26 And the LORD said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sakes." 27 And Abraham answered and said, "Behold now, I, who am dust and ashes, have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord. 28 Perhaps there will lack five of the fifty righteous. Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?" And he said, "If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy it." 29 And he spoke to him yet again, and said, "Perhaps there will be forty found there." And he said, "I will not do it for the forty's sake." 30 And he said, "Oh do not let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Perhaps there will be thirty found there." And he said, "I will not do it if I find thirty there." 31 And he said, "Behold now, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord. Perhaps there will be twenty found there." And he said, "I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake." 32 And he said, "Oh do not let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. Perhaps ten will be found there." And he said, "I will not destroy it for ten's sake." 33 And the LORD went his way as soon as he had finished speaking with Abraham. And Abraham returned to his place.

_Lot entertains two angels, 1-3. The vicious Sodomites are smitten with blindness, 4-11. Lot is warned, and in vain warns his sons-in-law, 12-14. He is directed to flee with his family to the mountains, but obtains leave to go into Zoar, 15-23. Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed, 24, 25. Lot's wife becomes a pillar of salt, 26-28. Lot dwells in a cave, 29, 30. The incestuous origin of Moab and Ammon, 31-38._

1 And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening. And Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. And Lot, seeing them, rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face toward the ground. 2 And he said, "Behold now, my lords, turn, I pray you, into your servant's house and stay all night and wash your feet, and you shall rise early and go on your way." And they said, "No, but we will abide in the street all night." 3 And he urged them greatly, and they turned aside to him and entered into his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both old and young, all the people from every quarter. 5 And they called to Lot and said to him, "Where are the men who came to you this night? Bring them out to us so that we may know them." 6 And Lot went out to them through the door and shut the door behind him, 7 And said, "I pray you, brothers, do not act so wickedly. 8 Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man. Let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do to them as is good in your eyes. Only do nothing to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof." 9 And they said, "Stand back." And they said again, "This one came in as a sojourner and he wants to be a judge. Now we will deal worse with you than with them." And they pressed hard upon the man, Lot, and came near to break the door. 10 But the men put forth their hand, pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. 11 And they smote the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.

12 And the men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of this place. 13 For we will destroy this place, because their cry has become great before the face of the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it." 14 And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, "Arise, depart from this place, for the LORD will destroy this city." But he seemed to his sons-in-law as one who mocked.

15 And when the morning arose, the angels hastened Lot, saying, "Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city." 16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters—the LORD being merciful to him—and they brought him forth and set him outside the city. 17 And it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, "Escape for your life. Do not look behind you, neither stay in all the plain. Escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed." 18 And Lot said to them, "Oh, not so, my Lord! 19 Behold now, your servant has found grace in your sight, and you have magnified your mercy, which you have shown to me in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil should take me and I die. 20 Behold now, this city is near to flee to and it is a small one. Oh, let me escape there (Is it not a small one?) and my soul shall live!" 21 And he said to him, "Behold, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city of which you have spoken. 22 Hasten, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you get there." Therefore, the name of the city was called Zoar.

23 The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven. 25 And he overthrew those cities and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground. 26 But his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt.

27 And Abraham rose early in the morning to go to the place where he stood before the LORD. 28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld, and behold, the smoke of the country went up like the smoke of a furnace.

29 And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.

30 And Lot went up from Zoar and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Zoar. And he dwelt in a cave—he and his two daughters. 31 And the first-born said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth. 32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him so that we may preserve the family of our father." 33 And they made their father drink wine that night. And the first-born went in and lay with her father, and he did not perceive when she lay down, nor when she arose. 34 And it came to pass on the next day that the first born said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine this night also, and you go in and lie with him so that we may preserve the family of our father." 35 And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not perceive when she lay down, nor when she arose. 36 Thus both of the daughters of Lot were with child by their father. 37 And the first-born bore a son and called his name Moab. The same is the father of the Moabites to this day. 38 And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. The same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.

1 And Abraham journeyed from there toward the south country and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in Gerar. 2 And Abraham said about Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. 3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man on account of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife." 4 But Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, "Lord, will you also slay a righteous nation? 5 Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister?' And she, even she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this." 6 And God said to him in a dream, "Indeed, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore, I did not allow you to touch her. 7 Now therefore, restore to the man his wife, for he is a prophet and he shall pray for you, and you shall live. And if you shall not restore her, know that you shall surely die—you and all who are yours."

8 Therefore, Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears. And the men were greatly afraid. 9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And in what have I offended you that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done." 10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see that you have done this thing?" 11 And Abraham said, "Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 12 And yet indeed she is my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. 13 And it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This is your kindness which you shall show to me: at every place where we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'" 14 And Abimelech took sheep, oxen, men-servants, and women-servants and gave them to Abraham and restored to him Sarah his wife. 15 And Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you." 16 And to Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother one thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is to you a covering of the eyes to all who are with you. And before all others, you are righted." 17 So Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his women-servants, and they bore children. 18 For the LORD had made barren all the females of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken. 2 For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 3 And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. 4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him. 5 And Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. 6 And Sarah said, "God has made me to laugh so that all who hear will laugh with me." 7 And she said, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah shall nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age."

8 And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned.

9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne to Abraham, mocking. [[gen021-010]]10 Therefore, she said to Abraham, "Cast out this woman-servant and her son. For the son of this woman-servant shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac." 11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. [[gen021-012]]12 And God said to Abraham, "Do not let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy and because of your woman-servant. In all that Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice. For in Isaac your offspring shall be called. 13 And also of the son of the woman-servant I will make a nation because he is your child." 14 And Abraham rose early in the morning, took bread and a bottle of water, gave it to Hagar (putting it on her shoulder) and the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.

15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 16 And she went and sat herself down over against him a good way off, about a bow-shot, for she said, "Do not let me see the death of the child." And she sat over against him and raised her voice and wept. 17 And God heard the voice of the boy. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said to her, "What ails you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. 18 Arise, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand, for I will make him a great nation." 19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the boy a drink.

20 And God was with the boy, and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer. 21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do. 23 Now therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me and to the land in which you have sojourned." 24 And Abraham said, "I will swear." 25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 26 And Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done this thing, neither did you tell me, neither did I hear about it until today."

27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and both of them made a covenant. 28 And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. 29 And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe-lambs mean which you have set by themselves?" 30 And he said, "You shall take these seven ewe-lambs from my hand so that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well." 31 Therefore, he called that place Beer-sheba, because there the both of them swore. 32 Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. Then Abimelech arose, with Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba and there called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. 34 And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.

1 And it came to pass after these things, that God tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham." And he said, "Behold, here I am." 2 And he said, "Now take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will name to you." 3 And Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son, split the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose and went to the place which God had named to him. 4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off. 5 And Abraham said to his young men, "Abide here with the donkey, and the boy and I will go yonder and worship and return to you." 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering and laid it upon Isaac his son, and he took the fire in his hand and a knife, and the both of them went together. 7 And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am, my son." And he said, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?" 8 And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering." So the both of them went together.

9 And they came to the place which God had named to him. And Abraham built an altar there, laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 11 And the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham." And he said, "Here I am." 12 And he said, "Do not lay your hand upon the boy, neither do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld from me your son, your only son." 13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered him for a burnt-offering instead of his son. 14 And Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide, as it is said to this day, "On the mountain of the LORD it will be seen."

15 And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven the second time, 16 And said, "By myself I have sworn, says the LORD, for because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son, [[gen022-017]]17 That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is on the sea shore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies.

20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, "Behold, Milcah, she has also borne children to your brother Nahor: 21 Huz his first-born, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel." 23 And Bethuel begot Rebekah.

_The age and death of Sarah, 1, 2. The purchase of the field and cave of Machpelah, 3-18; where Sarah is buried, 19, 20._

1 And Sarah was one hundred and twenty-seven years old. These were the years of the life of Sarah. 2 And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying, 4 "I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession for a burying-place with you so that I may bury my dead out of my sight." 5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, 6 "Hear us, my lord. You are a mighty prince among us. In the choice of our sepulchers bury your dead. None of us will withhold from you his sepulcher so that you may bury your dead." 7 And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth. 8 And he spoke with them, saying, "If it is your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 9 So that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For as much money as it is worth he shall give it to me as a possession for a burying-place among you." 10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, of all who entered the gates of his city, saying, 11 "No, my lord, hear me. I give the field to you, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead." 12 And Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land. 13 And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, "But if you will give it, I pray you, hear me. I will give you money for the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there." 14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 15 "My lord, listen to me. The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver. What is that between you and me? Therefore, bury your dead." 16 And Abraham listened to Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.

17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were throughout all its borders, were made sure 18 To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who entered the gate of his city. 19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 20 And the field and the cave that is in it were made sure to Abraham for a possession for a burying-place by the sons of Heth.

1 And Abraham was old and far advanced in age, and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. 2 And Abraham said to his eldest servant of his house who ruled over all that he had, "Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, 3 And I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell. 4 But you shall go to my country and to my kindred and take a wife for my son Isaac." 5 And the servant said to him, "It may be that the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I bring your son back to the land from where you came?" 6 And Abraham said to him, "Beware that you do not bring my son there again. 7 The LORD God of heaven who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. 8 And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath of mine. Only do not bring my son there again." 9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning that matter.

10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed (for all the goods of his master were in his hands), and he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. 11 And he made his camels to kneel down outside the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, the time when women go out to draw water. 12 And he said, "O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray you, prosper me this day and show kindness to my master Abraham. 13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water. 14 And let it come to pass, that the young woman to whom I say, 'Let down your pitcher, I pray you, so that I may drink,' and she shall say, 'Drink, and I will give your camels drink also,' let the same be she whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. And by that I shall know that you have shown kindness to my master."

15 And it came to pass before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. 16 And the young woman was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up. 17 And the servant ran to meet her and said, "Let me, I pray you, drink a little water from your pitcher." 18 And she said, "Drink, my lord." And she hastened and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink. 19 And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, "I will draw water for your camels also until they have finished drinking." 20 And she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. 21 And the man, wondering at her, held his peace to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

22 And it came to pass as the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden earring weighing half a shekel and two bracelets for her hands weighing ten shekels of gold, 23 And said, "Whose daughter are you? Tell me, I pray you, is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?" 24 And she said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor." 25 She said moreover to him, "We have enough of both straw and provender and room to lodge in." 26 And the man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD. 27 And he said, "Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who has not left my master destitute of his mercy and his truth. I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brothers."

28 And the young woman ran and told these things to her mother's house. 29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. And Laban ran out to the man at the well. 30 And it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, "Thus spoke the man to me," that he came to the man. And behold, he stood by the camels at the well. 31 And he said, "Come in, you blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels." 32 And the man came into the house, and he ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 33 And there was food set before him to eat. But he said, "I will not eat until I have told my errand." And he said, "Speak on." 34 And he said, "I am Abraham's servant. 35 And the LORD has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great. And he has given him flocks, herds, silver, gold, men-servants, woman-servants, camels, and donkeys. 36 And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. And to him he has given all that he has. 37 And my master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell. 38 But you shall go to my father's house and to my kindred and take a wife for my son.' 39 And I said to my master, 'It may be that the woman will not follow me.' 40 And he said to me, 'The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you and prosper your way, and you shall take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father's house. 41 Then you shall be clear from this oath of mine when you come to my kindred. And if they do not give you one, you shall be clear from my oath.'

42 "And I came this day to the well and said, 'O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now you prosper my way which I go, 43 Behold, I stand by the well of water, and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin comes forth to draw water, and I say to her, "Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher to drink," 44 And she says to me, "Drink, and I will also draw for your camels," let the same be the woman whom the LORD has pointed out for my master's son.'

45 "And before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder, and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her, 'Let me drink, I pray you.' 46 And she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.' So I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 47 And I asked her and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' And she said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' And I put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands. 48 And I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son. 49 And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me so that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."

50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and said, "The thing proceeds from the LORD. We cannot speak to you bad or good. 51 Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the LORD has spoken."

52 And it came to pass, that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshiped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. 53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother precious things. 54 And they ate and drank—he and the men who were with him—and stayed all night. And they rose in the morning, and he said, "Send me away to my master." 55 And her brother and her mother said, "Let the young woman abide with us a few days, at the least ten. After that she shall go." 56 And he said to them, "Do not hinder me, seeing the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away so that I may go to my master." 57 And they said, "We will call the young woman and ask her." 58 And they called Rebekah, and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" And she said, "I will go." 59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, her nurse, Abraham's servant, and his men. 60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her,

61 And Rebekah and her attendants arose, and they rode upon the camels and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah and went his way.

62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi, for he dwelt in the south country. 63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, the camels were coming. 64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel, 65 And she said to the servant, "What man is this who walks in the field to meet us?" And the servant said, "It is my master." Therefore, she took a veil and covered herself. 66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. 67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 2 And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 3 And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 4 And the sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 5 And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. 6 But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son (while he still lived) eastward to the east country.

7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years. 8 Then Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people. 9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre, 10 The field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife. 11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.

12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's servant, bore to Abraham. 13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 15 Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 16 These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their towns and by their castles, twelve princes according to their nations. 17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years. And he expired and died and was gathered to his people. 18 And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that is before Egypt, as far as toward Assyria. And he died in the presence of all his brothers.

19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begot Isaac. 20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to be his wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 21 And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD granted him his request, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 22 And the children struggled together within her, and she said, "If it is so, why am I thus?" And she went to inquire of the LORD. [[gen025-023]]23 And the LORD said to her,

24 And when her days to deliver were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 25 And the first was born red, and the whole of him was like a hairy garment. And they called his name Esau. 26 And after that, his brother was born, and his hand took hold of Esau's heel. And his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.

27 And the boys grew. And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents. 28 And Isaac loved Esau because he ate his wild game, but Rebekah loved Jacob. 29 And Jacob boiled pottage, and Esau came from the field and he was faint. 30 And Esau said to Jacob, "Feed me, I pray you, with that same red pottage, for I am faint." Therefore, his name was called Edom. 31 And Jacob said, "Sell to me this day your birth-right." 32 And Esau said, "Behold, I am at the point to die, and what profit shall this birth-right bring to me?" 33 And Jacob said, "Swear to me this day." And he swore to him and sold his birth-right to Jacob. 34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birth-right.

[.outline.text-center]
_Isaac, because of famine, sojourns in Gerar, and the Lord instructs and blesses him, 1-6. He is reproved by Abimelech for denying his wife, 7-11. He grows rich, and the Philistines envy his prosperity, 12-17. He digs Esek, Sitnah, and Rehoboth, 18-22. God appears to him at Beer-sheba and blesses him; and Abimelech makes a covenant with him, 23-33. Esau's wives, 34, 35._

1 And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines in Gerar. 2 And the LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down into Egypt. Dwell in the land of which I shall tell you. 3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and to your offspring I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. [[gen026-004]]4 And I will make your offspring to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these countries. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, 5 Because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."

6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. 7 And the men of the place asked him about his wife, and he said, "She is my sister," for he feared to say, "She is my wife"—"lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she is fair to look upon." 8 And it came to pass when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw, and behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah his wife. 9 And Abimelech called Isaac and said, "Behold, surely she is your wife. And how did you say, 'She is my sister'?" And Isaac said to him, "Because I thought, 'Lest I should die on her account.'" 10 And Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might lightly have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guiltiness upon us." 11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, "He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."

12 Then Isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year one hundred-fold. And the LORD blessed him. 13 And the man became great and went forward and grew until he became very great. 14 For he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds, and very many servants. And the Philistines envied him. 15 For all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth. 16 And Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go from us, for you are much mightier than we are." 17 And Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar and dwelt there.

18 And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 19 And Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of springing water. 20 And the herdsmen of Gerar contended with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours." And he called the name of the well Esek because they strove with him. 21 And they dug another well and contended for that also, and he called its name Sitnah. 22 And he departed from there and dug another well. And for that they did not contend. And he called its name Rehoboth and he said, "For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."

23 And he went up from there to Beer-sheba.

24 And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, "I am the God of Abraham your father. Do not fear, for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake."

25 And he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there. And Isaac's servants dug a well there.

26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, along with Ahuzzath one of his friends and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 27 And Isaac said to them, "Why do you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?" 28 And they said, "We saw certainly that the LORD was with you. And we said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you, 29 That you will do us no hurt, as we have not touched you and as we have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.'" 30 And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. 31 And they rose early in the morning and swore to one another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had dug and said to him, "We have found water." 33 And he called it Shebah; therefore, the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.

34 And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite, 35 Who were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.

Isaac trembles, 33. Esau complains, and by importunity obtains a blessing, 34-40. He threatens Jacob's life, 41. Rebekah disappoints him by sending Jacob away, 42-46._

1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son and said to him, "My son." And he said to him, "Behold, here I am." 2 And he said, "Behold now, I am old. I do not know the day of my death. 3 Now therefore, take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt some wild game for me. 4 And make me savory food such as I love and bring it to me so that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die."

5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for wild game and to bring it. 6 And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, "Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, 7 'Bring me wild game and make me savory food so that I may eat and bless you in the presence of the LORD before my death.' 8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, according to that which I command you. 9 Go now to the flock and bring me from there two good kids of the goats, and I will make them savory food for your father such as he loves. 10 And you shall bring it to your father so that he may eat and that he may bless you before his death." 11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. 12 My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver, and I shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing." 13 And his mother said to him, "Let your curse be upon me, my son. Only obey my voice and go, bring them to me." 14 And he went and took and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food such as his father loved. 15 And Rebekah took fine clothing of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob her younger son. 16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 17 And she gave the savory food and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob.

18 And he came to his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?" 19 And Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your first-born. I have done according as you told me. Arise, I pray you, sit and eat some of my wild game so that your soul may bless me." 20 And Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?" And he said, "Because the LORD your God brought it to me." 21 And Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near, I pray you, so that I may feel you, my son, whether you are my very son Esau or not." 22 And Jacob went near to Isaac his father. And he felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau." 23 And he did not discern him because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him. 24 And he said, "Are you my very son Esau?" And he said, "I am." 25 And he said, "Bring it near to me, and I will eat some of my son's wild game so that my soul may bless you." And he brought it near to him, and he ate, and he brought him wine, and he drank. 26 And his father Isaac said to him, "Come near now and kiss me, my son." 27 And he came near and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his clothing and blessed him and said,

30 And it came to pass as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 31 And he also had made savory food and brought it to his father, and said to his father, "Let my father arise and eat some of his son's wild game so that your soul may bless me." 32 And Isaac his father said to him, "Who are you?" And he said, "I am your son, your first-born, Esau." 33 And Isaac trembled exceedingly and said, "Who? Where is he who has taken this wild game and brought it to me, and I have eaten all of it before you came and have blessed him? Indeed, he shall be blessed." 34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, O my father." 35 And he said, "Your brother came with subtlety and has taken away your blessing." 36 And he said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me twice: he took away my birth-right, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing." And he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?" 37 And Isaac answered and said to Esau, "Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. And what shall I do now to you, my son?" 38 And Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father." And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.

39 And Isaac his father answered and said to him,

41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, "The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will slay my brother Jacob." 42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, "Behold, your brother Esau, as concerning you, comforts himself, purposing to kill you. 43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. And arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran. 44 And stay with him a few days until your brother's fury turns away, 45 Until your brother's anger turns away from you and he forgets that which you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be deprived of you both in one day?"

46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, such as these, who are from the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?"

_Isaac blesses Jacob and sends him to Padan-aram, 1-5. Esau marries Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, 6-9. Jacob journeys and has a vision of a ladder, 10-17. The stone of Beth-el, 18, 19. Jacob's vow, 20-22._

1 And Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. 2 Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father, and take for yourself from there a wife from the daughters of Laban your mother's brother. 3 And may God Almighty bless you, make you fruitful, and multiply you so that you may be a multitude of people, 4 And give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you, so that you may inherit the land in which you are a stranger, which God gave to Abraham." 5 And Isaac sent away Jacob. And he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.

6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan-aram to take for himself a wife from there, and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan," 7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padan-aram, 8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father, 9 Then Esau went to Ishmael and took, besides the wives which he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.

10 And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. 11 And he alighted upon a certain place and stayed there all night because the sun had set. And he took some of the stones of that place and set them for his head-rest and lay down in that place to sleep. [[gen028-012]]12 And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. 13 And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, "I am the LORD God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your offspring. 14 And your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, to the east, to the north, and to the south. And in you and in your offspring all the families of the earth shall be blessed. 15 And behold, I am with you and will keep you in all places where you go and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you until I have done that which I have declared to you." 16 And Jacob awoke out of his sleep and he said, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it." 17 And he was afraid and said, "How awesome this place is! This is no other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."

18 And Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his head-rest, set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on top of it. 19 And he called the name of that place Beth-el, but the name of that city was called Luz at the first. 20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, keep me in this way that I go, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on, 21 So that I come back to my father's house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God. 22 And this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house. And of all that you give me, I will surely give the tenth to you."

He serves for seven more years and marries Rachel also, 28-31. Leah bears Reuben, 32; Simeon, 33; Levi, 34; and Judah, 35._

1 Then Jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east. 2 And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and behold, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it, for out of that well they watered the flocks. And a great stone was upon the well's mouth. 3 And there all the flocks were gathered. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep. Then they put the stone back upon the well's mouth in its place.

4 And Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where are you from?" And they said, "We are from Haran." 5 And he said to them, "Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?" And they said, "We know him." 6 And he said to them, "Is he well?" And they said, "He is well, and behold, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep." 7 And he said, "Behold, it is still the middle of the day, neither is it time that the livestock should be collected. Water the sheep and go and feed them." 8 And they said, "We cannot until all the flocks are collected and until they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep."

9 And while he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them. 10 And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 11 And Jacob kissed Rachel and lifted up his voice and wept. 12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father.

13 And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, embraced him, kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. 14 And Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh." And he stayed with him for a month.

15 And Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?" 16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah and the name of the younger was Rachel. 17 Leah was tender-eyed, but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored. 18 And Jacob loved Rachel and said, "I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter." 19 And Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me." 20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him only a few days because of the love he had for her.

21 And Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife (for my days are fulfilled) so that I may go in to her." 22 And Laban assembled all the men of the place and made a feast. 23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he went in to her. 24 And Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah as a servant. 25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?" 26 And Laban said, "It must not be thus done in our country to give the younger before the first-born. 27 Fulfill her week, and we will give you the other also for the service which you shall serve with me for seven more years." 28 And Jacob did so and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel, his daughter, for a wife also. 29 And Laban gave Bilhah his servant to Rachel his daughter to be her servant. 30 And he went in also to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him for seven more years.

31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he made her fruitful, but Rachel was barren. 32 And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, "Surely the LORD has looked upon my affliction; therefore, now my husband will love me." 33 And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, "Because the LORD has heard that I was hated, he has therefore given me this son also." And she called his name Simeon. 34 And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, "Now this time my husband will adhere to me because I have borne him three sons." Therefore, his name was called Levi. 35 And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, "Now I will praise the LORD." Therefore, she called his name Judah, and ceased bearing.

1 And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister and said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I die." 2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel and he said, "Am I in God's stead, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?" 3 And she said, "Behold, my servant Bilhah, go in to her, and she shall bear upon my knees so that I may also have children by her." 4 And she gave him Bilhah her servant for a wife, and Jacob went in to her. 5 And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. 6 And Rachel said, "God has judged me and has also heard my voice and has given me a son." Therefore, she called his name Dan. 7 And Bilhah, Rachel's servant, conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. 8 And Rachel said, "With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and I have prevailed." And she called his name Naphtali.

9 When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing, she took Zilpah her servant and gave her to Jacob for a wife. 10 And Zilpah, Leah's servant, bore Jacob a son. 11 And Leah said, "A troop comes." And she called his name Gad. 12 And Zilpah, Leah's servant, bore Jacob a second son. 13 And Leah said, "Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed." And she called his name Asher.

14 And Reuben went, in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Give me, I pray you, some of your son's mandrakes." 15 And she said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband? And would you take away my son's mandrakes also?" And Rachel said, "Therefore, he shall lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes." 16 And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me. For surely I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." And he lay with her that night. 17 And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. 18 And Leah said, "God has given me my hire because I have given my servant to my husband." And she called his name Issachar. 19 And Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son. 20 And Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good dower. Now my husband will dwell with me because I have borne him six sons." And she called his name Zebulun. 21 And afterward, she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.

22 And God remembered Rachel. And God listened to her and rendered her fruitful. 23 And she conceived and bore a son, and said, "God has taken away my reproach." 24 And she called his name Joseph and said, "The LORD will add to me another son."

25 And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away so that I may go to my own place and to my country. 26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and let me go. For you know my service which I have done for you." 27 And Laban said to him, "I pray you, if I have found favor in your eyes, stay, for I have learned by experience that the LORD has blessed me for your sake." 28 And he said, "Appoint me your wages and I will give it." 29 And he said to him, "You know how I have served you and how your livestock were with me. 30 For it was little which you had before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude, and the LORD has blessed you since my coming. And now when shall I provide for my own house also?" 31 And he said, "What shall I give you?" And Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock. 32 I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, all the brown ones among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and of such shall be my hire. 33 So my righteousness shall answer for me in time to come when you come for my hire before your face. Each one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, shall be accounted stolen with me." 34 And Laban said, "Behold, let it be according to your word." 35 And he removed that day the male goats that were striped and spotted and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, each one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hands of his sons. 36 And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

37 And Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar, hazel, and plane-tree, and peeled white streaks in them and made the white appear which was in the rods. 38 And he set the rods, which he had peeled, before the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs when the flocks came to drink so that they should conceive when they came to drink. 39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flock brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted. 40 And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the brown in the flock of Laban. And he put his own flocks by themselves, and did not put them with Laban's flock. 41 And it came to pass whenever the stronger flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters so that they might conceive among the rods. 42 But when the flock was feeble, he did not put them in. So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 43 And the man increased exceedingly and had many flocks, women-servants, men-servants, camels, and donkeys.

Rachel's stratagem to hide the images, 34, 35. Jacob reproaches Laban, 36-42. The covenant of Laban and Jacob at Galeed, 43-55._

1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father's, and from that which was our father's he has obtained all this glory." 2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not toward him as before. 3 And the LORD said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you." 4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was, 5 And said to them, "I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before, but the God of my father has been with me. 6 And you know that with all my power I have served your father. 7 And your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to hurt me. 8 If he said, 'The speckled shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled. And if he said, 'The striped shall be your hire,' then all the flock bore striped. 9 Thus God has taken away the flock of your father and given them to me. 10 And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived, that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the flock were striped, speckled, and grizzled. 11 And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, 'Jacob.' And I said, 'Here I am.' 12 And he said, 'Lift up now your eyes and see that all the rams which leap upon the flock are striped, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you. 13 I am the God of Beth-el, where you anointed the pillar and where you vowed to me a vow. Now arise, depart from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.'" 14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, "Is there still any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 15 Are we not regarded by him as strangers? For he has sold us and has also quite consumed our money. 16 For all the riches which God has taken from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then whatever God has said to you, do."

17 Then Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives upon camels. 18 And he carried away all his livestock and all his goods which he had gained, his own livestock which he had gained in Padan-aram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. 19 And Laban went to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's. 20 And Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he was about to depart. 21 So he fled with all that he had, and he arose and passed over the river and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.

22 And it was told to Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled. 23 And he took his brothers with him and pursued after him seven days' journey, and they overtook him in the mountains of Gilead. 24 And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream by night and said to him, "Take heed that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad."

25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent on the mountain, and Laban, with his brothers, pitched on the mountain of Gilead. 26 And Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done that you have deceived me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword? 27 Why did you flee away secretly and steal away from me and not tell me? I would have sent you away with mirth, with songs, with tambourine, and with harp. 28 You have not allowed me to kiss my sons and my daughters. You have now done foolishly in so doing. 29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.' 30 And now, you have gone away because you earnestly longed after your father's house, yet why have you stolen my gods?" 31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought it may be that you would take your daughters from me by force. 32 With whomever you find your gods, do not let him live. Before our brothers, discern what is yours with me and take it." For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.

33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the two women-servants' tents, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah's tent and entered into Rachel's tent. 34 Now Rachel had taken the images and put them in the camel's saddle and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but did not find them. 35 And she said to her father, "Do not let it displease my lord that I cannot rise up before you, for the custom of women is upon me." And he searched, but did not find the images.

36 And Jacob was angry and chided with Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, "What is my trespass? What is my sin that you have so eagerly pursued after me? 37 Now that you have searched all my stuff, what have you found of all your household-stuff? Set it here before my brothers and your brothers so that they may judge between us both. 38 These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried their young, and the rams of your flock I have not eaten. 39 That which was torn by beasts, I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 40 Thus I was: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep departed from my eyes. 41 Thus I have been twenty years in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. 42 Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands and he rebuked you last night."

43 And Laban answered and said to Jacob, "These daughters are my daughters, these children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these daughters of mine, or to their children which they have borne? 44 Now therefore, come, let us make a covenant—you and I—and let it be for a witness between you and me." 45 And Jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar. 46 And Jacob said to his brothers, "Gather stones." And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there upon the heap. 47 And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. 48 And Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me this day." Therefore, the name of it was called Galeed, 49 And Mizpah, for he said, "May the LORD watch between you and me when we are absent from one another. 50 If you afflict my daughters, or if you take other wives besides my daughters, and no man is with us, behold, God is witness between you and me." 51 And Laban said to Jacob, "Behold this heap and behold this pillar which I have set between you and me. 52 This heap is a witness and this pillar is a witness that I will not pass over this heap to you and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me for harm. 53 May the God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. 54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mountain and called his brothers to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night on the mountain. 55 And early in the morning Laban arose, kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed and returned to his place.

1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, "This is God's host." And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 4 And he commanded them, saying, "Thus you shall speak to my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says thus: "I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now. 5 And I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, men-servants, and women-servants. And I have sent to tell my lord so that I may find grace in your sight."'"

6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and he is also coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him." 7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. And he divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, herds, and camels, into two bands, 8 And said, "If Esau comes to one company and smites it, then the other company which is left will escape."

9 And Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you,' 10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which you have shown to your servant. For with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two bands. 11 Deliver me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he should come and smite me with the mothers and the children. 12 And you said, 'I will surely do you good and make your offspring like the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude.'"

13 And he lodged there that same night and took from that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother: 14 Two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, twenty rams, 15 Thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten foals. 16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves, and said to his servants, "Pass over before me and put a space between drove and drove." 17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, "When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, 'Whose are you? And where do you go? And whose are these before you?' 18 Then you shall say, 'They are your servant Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord Esau. And behold he is also behind us.'" 19 And likewise he commanded the second, the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, "In this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him. 20 And say moreover, 'Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us.'" For he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward, I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me." 21 So the present went over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the company.

22 And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two women-servants, and his eleven sons and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. 23 And he took them and sent them over the brook, and sent over that which he had.

24 And Jacob was left alone. And there a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day. 25 And when [the man] saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of [Jacob's] thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him. 26 And [the man] said, "Let me go, for the day breaks." And [Jacob] said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me." 27 And [the man] said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob." 28 And he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel. For as a prince you have power with God and with men, and have prevailed." 29 And Jacob asked him and said, "Tell me, I pray you, your name." And he said, "Why is it that you ask for my name?" And he blessed him there. 30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." 31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he limped upon his thigh. 32 Therefore, the children of Israel do not eat of the sinew which shrunk, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrunk.

_Jacob and Esau's meeting; and Esau's departure, 1-16. Jacob comes to Succoth, 17. At Shalem he buys a field and builds an altar called El-elohe-Israel, 18-20._

1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two women-servants. 2 And he put the women-servants and their children foremost, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindmost. 3 And he passed on before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother.

4 And Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they wept. 5 And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said, "Who are those with you?" And he said, "The children which God has graciously given to your servant." 6 Then the women-servants came near—they and their children—and they bowed themselves. 7 And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed themselves. And afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed themselves. 8 And he said, "What do you mean by all this drove which I met?" And he said, "These are to find grace in the sight of my lord." 9 And Esau said, "I have enough, my brother. Keep what you have to yourself." 10 And Jacob said, "No, I pray you, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand. For therefore I have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God, and you have been pleased with me. 11 Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have enough." And he urged him, and he took it.

12 And he said, "Let us take our journey and let us go, and I will go before you." 13 And he said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me, and if men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die. 14 Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant, and I will lead on slowly, according as the livestock that go before me and the children are able to endure, until I come to my lord at Seir."

15 And Esau said, "Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with me." And he said, "What need is there? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord." 16 So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. 17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore, the name of the place is called Succoth.

18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram, and pitched his tent before the city. 19 And he bought a part of a field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money. 20 And he erected an altar there and called it El-elohe-Israel.

1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 2 And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her and lay with her and defiled her. 3 And his soul cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke kindly to the young woman. 4 And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, "Get me this young woman for a wife." 5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, and Jacob held his peace until they had come. 6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. 7 And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard it, and the men were grieved and were very angry because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter, which thing ought not to be done.

8 And Hamor spoke with them, saying, "The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. I pray you give her to him for a wife. 9 And make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves. 10 And you shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you. Dwell and trade therein and get possessions therein." 11 And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and what you shall say to me, I will give. 12 Ask me ever so much dowry and gift and I will give according as you shall say to me, but give me the young woman for a wife."

13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully and said (because he had defiled Dinah their sister), 14 And they said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, because that would be a reproach to us. 15 But in this we will consent to you: if you will be as we are, that every male of you shall be circumcised, 16 Then we will give our daughters to you and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 17 But if you will not listen to us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and we will be gone."

18 And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son. 19 And the young man did not defer to do the thing because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. And he was more honorable than all the house of his father. 20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city and spoke with the men of their city, saying, 21 "These men are peaceable with us; therefore, let them dwell in the land and trade therein. For the land, behold, it is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters for wives and let us give them our daughters. 22 Only herein will the men consent to us to dwell with us to be one people: if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised. 23 Will their livestock, their substance, and every beast of theirs not be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us." 24 And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to Shechem his son. And every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.

25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males. 26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem's house and went out. 27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city because they had defiled their sister. 28 They took their sheep, their oxen, their donkeys, that which was in the city, and that which was in the field. 29 And all their wealth, all their little ones, and their wives they took captive and plundered even all that was in the house. 30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have troubled me to make me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. And I being few in number, they will assemble themselves against me and slay me, and I shall be destroyed—I and my house." 31 And they said, "Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?"

The age, death, and burial of Isaac, 28, 29._

1 And God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Beth-el and dwell there. And make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother." 2 Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Put away the strange gods which are among you, and be clean and change your garments. 3 And let us arise and go up to Beth-el. And I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went." 4 And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and the earrings which were in their ears. And Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

5 And they journeyed. And the terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (that is Beth-el)—he and all the people who were with him. 7 And he erected there an altar and called the place El-beth-el because there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother. 8 But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el under an oak. And its name was called Allon-bachuth.

9 And God appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram, and he blessed him.

10 And God said to him, "Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name." And he called his name Israel.

11 And God said to him, "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a multitude of nations shall spring from you, and kings shall come out of your loins.

12 And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you. And to your offspring after you I will give the land."

13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink-offering thereon and he poured oil thereon. 15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him Beth-el.

16 And they journeyed from Beth-el. And there was only a little distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed and had hard labor. 17 And it came to pass when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, "Do not fear. You shall have this son also." 18 And it came to pass as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni, but his father called him Benjamin. 19 And Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem. 20 And Jacob set a pillar on her grave. That is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day. 21 And Israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.

22 And it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. And Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. 23 The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's first-born), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali. 26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Padan-aram.

27 And Jacob came to Isaac his father at Mamre, near Kirjath-arbah (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

28 And the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. 29 And Isaac expired and died and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

2 Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 3 And Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 4 And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel; 5 And Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.

6 And Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, all the persons of his house, his livestock, all his beasts, and all his substance which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 7 For their riches were too abundant for them to dwell together, and the land wherein they were strangers could not sustain them because of their livestock. 8 Thus Esau dwelt in the mountains of Seir. Esau is Edom.

9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the mountains of Seir. 10 These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, and Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau. 11 And the sons of Eliphaz were, Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 12 And Timna was a concubine to Eliphaz, Esau's son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife. 13 And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the sons of Bashemath, Esau's wife. 14 And these are the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife, and she bore to Esau, Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.

15 These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the first-born son of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, 16 Chief Korah, chief Gatam, and chief Amalek. These are the chiefs, descendants of Eliphaz, in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. 17 And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs, descendants of Reuel, in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Bashemath, Esau's wife. 18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah, Esau's wife: chief Jeush, chief Jaalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs, descendants of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. 19 These are the sons of Esau (who is Edom) and these are their chiefs.

20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite who inhabited the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. 22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Heman; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 23 And the children of Shobal are these: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 24 And these are the children of Zibeon: Ajah and Anah. This was that Anah who found the mules in the wilderness as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father. 25 And the children of Anah are these: Dishon and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah. 26 And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. 27 The children of Ezer are these: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Achan. 28 The children of Dishan are these: Uz and Aran. 29 These are the chiefs, descendants of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah, 30 Chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs, descendants of Hori, among their chiefs in the land of Seir.

31 And these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. 32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead. 35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad (who smote Midian in the field of Moab) reigned in his stead, and the name of his city was Avith. 36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 37 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. 38 And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 39 And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead, and the name of his city was Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.

40 And these are the names of the chiefs, descendants of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timnah, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth, 41 Chief Aholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon, 42 Chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar, 43 Chief Magdiel, and chief Iram.

1 And Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. 2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brothers, and the boy was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought to his father their evil report. 3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a coat of many colors. 4 And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.

5 And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him even more. 6 And he said to them, "Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed. 7 For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright, and behold, your sheaves stood around and made obeisance to my sheaf." 8 And his brothers said to him, "Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have dominion over us?" And they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.

9 And he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, "Behold, I have dreamed a dream again, and behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me." 10 And he told it to his father and to his brothers. And his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to you to the earth?" 11 And his brothers envied him, but his father observed the saying.

12 And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 13 And Israel said to Joseph, "Do your brothers not feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." And he said to him, "Here I am." 14 And he said to him, "Go, I pray you, see whether it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks, and bring word back to me." So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

15 And a certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, "What do you seek?" 16 And he said, "I seek my brothers. Tell me, I pray you, where they feed their flocks." 17 And the man said, "They have departed from here, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" And Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.

18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him. 19 And they said to one another, "Behold, this dreamer is coming. 20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him and cast him into some pit. And we will say, 'Some evil beast has devoured him.' Then we shall see what will become of his dreams." 21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him from their hands and said, "Let us not kill him." 22 And Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood. Cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him," so that he might deliver him from their hands to bring him back to his father. 23 And it came to pass when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him. 24 And they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit was empty. There was no water in it.

25 And they sat down to eat bread. And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, going to carry them down to Egypt. 26 And Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood. 27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and do not let our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our flesh." And his brothers were content. 28 Then there passed by Midianites, merchants, and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.

29 And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit. And he rent his clothes. 30 And he returned to his brothers and said, "The child is not there. And I, where shall I go?" 31 And they took Joseph's coat, killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood. 32 And they sent the coat of many colors and brought it to their father and said, "This we have found. Know now whether it is your son's coat or not." 33 And he knew it and said, "It is my son's coat. An evil beast has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces." 34 And Jacob rent his clothes, put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and he said, "For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning." Thus his father wept for him. 36 And the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard.

1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 2 And Judah saw a daughter of a certain Canaanite there, whose name was Shuah, and he took her and went in to her. 3 And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. 4 And she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. 5 And she yet again conceived and bore a son, and called his name Shelah. And he was at Chezib when she bore him.

6 And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, whose name was Tamar. 7 And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD slew him. 8 And Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife and marry her and raise up a child for your brother." 9 And Onan knew that the child would not be his. And it came to pass when he went in to his brother's wife, that he frustrated the purpose, lest he should give a child to his brother. 10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD; therefore, he slew him also. 11 Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow at your father's house until Shelah my son is grown," for he said, "Lest perhaps he die also as his brothers did." And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.

12 And in process of time, the daughter of Shuah, Judah's wife, died. And Judah was comforted and went up to his sheep-shearers at Timnath—he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 13 And it was told to Tamar, saying, "Behold, your father-in-law goes up to Timnath to shear his sheep." 14 And she took off her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath, for she saw that Shelah was grown and she was not given to him for a wife. 15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face. 16 And he turned to her by the way and said, "Come, I pray you, let me have access to you"—for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What will you give me so that you may have access to me?" 17 And he said, "I will send you a kid from the flock." And she said, "Will you give me a pledge until you send it?" 18 And he said, "What pledge shall I give you?" And she said, "Your signet, your bracelets, and your staff that is in your hand." And he gave them to her and came in to her, and she conceived by him. 19 And she arose and went her way and took off her veil from her and put on the garments of her widowhood.

20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to receive his pledge from the woman's hand, but he did not find her. 21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, "Where is the harlot who was openly by the wayside?" And they said, "There was no harlot in this place." 22 And he returned to Judah and said, "I cannot find her. And also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place." 23 And Judah said, "Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this kid, and you have not found her."

24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot, and also, behold she is with child by lewdness." And Judah said, "Bring her forth and let her be burnt." 25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "I am with child by the man whose these are." And she said, "Discern, I pray you, whose these are: the signet, bracelets, and staff." 26 And Judah acknowledged them and said, "She has been more righteous than I have because I did not give her to Shelah my son." And he knew her again no more.

27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb. 28 And it came to pass when she travailed, that one put out his hand, and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, "This one came out first." 29 And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out, and she said, "How have you broken forth? This breach is upon you." Therefore, his name was called Pharez. 30 And afterward, his brother came out who had the scarlet thread upon his hand, and his name was called Zarah.

1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hands of the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there. 2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man, and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake. And the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house and in the field. 6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and he did not know anything that he had, except the bread which he ate. And Joseph was a handsome person and well favored.

7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, "Lie with me." 8 But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Behold, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand. 9 There is no one greater in his house than I am, neither has he kept back anything from me but you because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?" 10 And it came to pass as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he did not listen to her, to lie by her or to be with her. 11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house there within. 12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me." And he left his garment in her hand and fled and went out. 13 And it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled forth, 14 That she called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, "See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. 15 And it came to pass when he heard that I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me and fled and went out." 16 And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home. 17 And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew servant which you have brought to us came to me to mock me. 18 And it came to pass as I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me and fled."

19 And it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him, saying, "After this manner your servant did to me," that his wrath was kindled. 20 And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound, and he was there in the prison. 21 But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison.

1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. 2 And Pharaoh was angry with two of his officers: with the chief of the butlers and with the chief of the bakers. 3 And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them, and they continued a season in custody. 5 And the both of them dreamed a dream, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream—the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt who were bound in the prison. 6 And Joseph came to them in the morning and looked upon them, and behold, they were sad. 7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, "Why do you look so sad today?" 8 And they said to him, "We have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it." And Joseph said to them, "Do interpretations not belong to God? Tell me them, I pray you."

9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him, "In my dream, behold, a vine was before me. 10 And on the vine were three branches. And it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes. 11 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand. And I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand." 12 And Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. 13 Within three days Pharaoh shall lift up your head and restore you to your place, and you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand after the former manner when you were his butler. 14 But think of me when it is well with you, and show kindness to me, I pray you, and make mention of me to Pharaoh and bring me out of this house. 15 For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."

16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, "I also was in my dream, and behold, I had three white baskets on my head. 17 And in the uppermost basket there was all manner of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head." 18 And Joseph answered and said, "This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days. 19 Within three days Pharaoh shall lift up your head from off you and hang you on a tree. And the birds shall eat your flesh from off you."

20 And it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. 21 And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. 22 But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. 23 Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.

So Pharaoh awoke. 5 And he slept and dreamed the second time. And behold, seven heads of grain came up upon one stalk, healthy and good. 6 And behold, seven heads, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 7 And the seven thin heads devoured the seven healthy and full heads. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. 8 And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof. And Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.

9 Then the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I remember my faults this day. 10 Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me in custody in the captain of the guard's house—both the chief baker and me. 11 And we dreamed a dream in one night—he and I. We each dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream. 12 And there was with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams to us. To each man according to his dream he interpreted. 13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, it was so. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him."

14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. And he shaved himself and changed his clothing and came before Pharaoh. 15 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have dreamed a dream and there is no one who can interpret it. And I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream to interpret it." 16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, "It is not in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace." 17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river. 18 And behold, there came out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed and well-favored, and they fed in a meadow. 19 And behold, seven other cows came out after them, poor, very ill-favored, and lean-fleshed, such that I never saw worse in all the land of Egypt. 20 And the lean and the ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows. 21 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 22 And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads came up on one stalk, full and good. 23 And behold, seven heads, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 24 And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. And I told this to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."

25 And Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dream of Pharaoh is one. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 26 The seven good cows are seven years and the seven good heads are seven years. The dream is one. 27 And the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty heads blasted with the east wind will be seven years of famine. 28 This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he shows to Pharaoh. 29 Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt. 30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land. 31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following, for it will be very grievous. 32 And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice. It is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. 33 Now therefore, let Pharaoh look for a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of Egypt. 34 Let Pharaoh do this: let him appoint officers over the land to take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 36 And that food shall be a store for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."

37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.

38 And Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find such a man as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?" 39 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Because God has shown you all this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you are. 40 You shall be over my house, and according to your word all my people shall be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than you." 41 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt." 42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand, arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck. 43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. And they cried before him, "Bow the knee." And he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. 44 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without you no man shall lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt." 45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah, and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. And Joseph went over all the land of Egypt.

46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 48 And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt and laid up the food in the cities. The food of the field which was around every city, he laid up in the same. 49 And Joseph gathered grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased numbering, for it was without number.

50 And to Joseph two sons were born before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him. 51 And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh. "For God," he said, "has made me forget all my toil and all my father's house." 52 And the name of the second he called Ephraim. "For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction."

53 And the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt had ended. 54 And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said. And the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do." 56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the store-houses and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt. 57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain because the famine was distressing in all lands.

_Jacob sends his ten sons to buy grain in Egypt, 1-15. They are imprisoned by Joseph, accused of being spies, 16, 17. They are set at liberty on the condition that they bring Benjamin, 18-20. They have remorse for Joseph, 21-23. Simeon is kept for a pledge, 24. They return with grain and their money, 25-28. They tell Jacob what happened, 29-35. Jacob refuses to send Benjamin, 36-38._

1 Now when Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?" 2 And he said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us from there so that we may live and not die." 3 And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. 4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob did not send with his brothers, for he said, "Lest perhaps mischief befalls him." 5 And the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the earth. 7 And Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them and spoke roughly to them, and he said to them, "From where have you come?" And they said, "From the land of Canaan to buy food."

8 And Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him. 9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them and said to them, "You are spies. You have come to see the nakedness of the land." 10 And they said to him, "No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. 11 We are all one man's sons. We are true men. Your servants are not spies." 12 And he said to them, "No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land." 13 And they said, "Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father and one is no more." 14 And Joseph said to them, "It is as I spoke to you, saying, 'You are spies.' 15 By this you shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh you shall not go forth from here unless your youngest brother comes here. 16 Send one of you and let him bring your brother. You shall be kept in prison so that your words may be proved whether there is any truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies." 17 And he put them all together into custody for three days.

18 And Joseph said to them on the third day, "Do this and live, for I fear God. 19 If you are true men, let one of your brothers be bound in the house of your prison. Go, carry grain for the famine of your houses, 20 But bring your youngest brother to me. Thus your words shall be verified, and you shall not die." And they did so. 21 And they said to one another, "We are truly guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he implored us, and we would not hear; therefore, this distress has come upon us." 22 And Reuben answered them, saying, "Did I not speak to you, saying, 'Do not sin against the young man,' and you would not hear? Therefore, behold, his blood is also required." 23 And they did not know that Joseph understood them because he spoke to them through an interpreter. 24 And he turned himself away from them and wept. And he returned to them again and spoke with them, and took from them Simeon and bound him before their eyes. 25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with grain, to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way. And thus he did to them.

26 And they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there. 27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey provender in the inn, he saw his money, for behold, it was in his sack's mouth. 28 And he said to his brothers, "My money is restored, and behold, it is even in my sack." And their hearts failed them and they were afraid, saying to one another, "What is this that God has done to us?"

29 And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that befell them, saying, 30 "The man who is the lord of the land spoke roughly to us and took us for spies of the country. 31 And we said to him, 'We are true men. We are not spies. 32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.' 33 And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, 'By this I shall know that you are true men: leave one of your brothers here with me, take food for the famine of your households, and depart, 34 But bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies, but that you are true men. Then I will deliver your brother to you and you shall trade in the land.'"

35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 36 And Jacob their father said to them, "You have bereaved me. Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you will take Benjamin away. All these things are against me." 37 And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, "Slay my two sons if I do not bring him to you. Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you." 38 And he said, "My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he is left alone. If mischief befalls him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."

_Jacob is hardly persuaded to send Benjamin, 1-14. Joseph entertains his brothers, 15-18. They reveal their fears to the steward, 19-25. Joseph makes them a feast, 26-34._

1 And the famine was severe in the land. 2 And it came to pass, when they had consumed the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go back, buy us a little food." 3 And Judah spoke to him, saying, "The man solemnly testified to us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.' 4 If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food. 5 But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'" 6 And Israel said, "Why did you deal so ill with me, as to tell the man whether you had another brother?" 7 And they said, "The man asked us strictly concerning our state and our kindred, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' And we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we certainly know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down?'" 8 And Judah said to Israel, his father, "Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go so that we may live and not die—we, you, and also our little ones. 9 I will be surety for him. From my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever. 10 For if we had not delayed, surely now we would have returned a second time."

11 And their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so now, do this: take some of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry to the man a present—a little balm, a little honey, spices, myrrh, nuts, and almonds. 12 And take double money in your hand. And the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry it back in your hand. It may be that it was an oversight. 13 Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man. 14 And may God Almighty give you mercy before the man so that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved, I am bereaved." 15 And the men took these presents, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin, and arose, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, "Bring these men home, and slay and make ready, for these men shall dine with me at noon." 17 And the man did as Joseph commanded. And the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 18 And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph's house, and they said, "Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we are brought in, so that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for slaves, along with our donkeys." 19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house and they spoke with him at the door of the house, 20 And said, "O sir, we came down indeed at the first time to buy food. 21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. And we have brought it back in our hand. 22 And we have brought other money down in our hands to buy food. We cannot tell who put our money in our sacks." 23 And he said, "Peace be to you. Do not fear. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I had your money." And he brought Simeon out to them. 24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their donkeys provender. 25 And they made ready the present until the coming of Joseph at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.

26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the earth. 27 And he asked them about their welfare and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?" 28 And they answered, "Your servant, our father, is in good health. He is still alive." And they bowed their heads and made obeisance. 29 And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your younger brother of whom you spoke to me?" And he said, "May God be gracious to you, my son." 30 And Joseph made haste, for his heart yearned toward his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered into his chamber and wept there. 31 And he washed his face, went out, and refrained himself, and said, "Serve the bread." 32 And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, for the Egyptians do not eat bread with the Hebrews because that is an abomination to the Egyptians. 33 And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birth-right and the youngest according to his youth. And the men wondered at one another. 34 And he took and sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.

_Joseph's stratagem to detain his brothers, 1-5. The cup is found in Benjamin's sack, 6-13. They are brought before Joseph, 14-17. Judah's humble supplication to Joseph, 18-34._

1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in his sack's mouth. 2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, along with his grain money." And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away—they and their donkeys. 4 And when they had gone out of the city and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, "Arise, follow after the men. And when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you rewarded evil for good? 5 Is this not the cup in which my lord drinks and by which indeed he divines? You have done evil in so doing.'"

6 And he overtook them and he spoke to them these same words. 7 And they said to him, "Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do according to this thing. 8 Behold, the money which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then should we steal from your lord's house silver or gold? 9 With whomever of your servants it shall be found, both let him die and we also will be my lord's slaves." 10 And he said, "Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it shall be found shall be my servant, and you shall be blameless." 11 Then they each speedily took down his sack to the ground and each opened his sack. 12 And he searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 13 Then they rent their clothes and each loaded his donkey and returned to the city.

14 And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house (for he was still there), and they fell before him on the ground. 15 And Joseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can certainly divine?" 16 And Judah said, "What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold we are my lord's servants—both we and he also with whom the cup is found." 17 And he said, "Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant. And as for you, go in peace to your father."

18 Then Judah came near to him, and said, "Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not let your anger burn against your servant, for you are even as Pharaoh. 19 My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Do you have a father, or a brother?' 20 And we said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. And his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.' 21 And you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me so that I may set my eyes upon him.' 22 And we said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.' 23 And you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.' 24 And it came to pass when we came to your servant, my father, that we told him the words of my lord. 25 And our father said, 'Go back. Buy us a little food.' 26 And we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down, for we may not see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.' 27 And your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons. 28 And one went out from me, and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces," and I have not seen him since. 29 And if you take this one also from me and mischief befalls him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.' 30 Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us (seeing that his life is bound up in the boy's life), 31 It shall come to pass when he sees that the boy is not with us, that he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 32 For your servant became surety for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him to you, then I will bear the blame before my father forever.' 33 Now therefore, I pray you, let your servant abide as a slave to my lord instead of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers. 34 For how shall I return to my father if the boy is not with me?—Lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father."

1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all those who stood by him. And he cried, "Cause every man to go out from me." And there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 2 And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. 3 And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Does my father still live?" And his brothers could not answer him because they were troubled at his presence.

4 And Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, I pray you." And they came near. And he said, "I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 5 Now therefore, do not be grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me here, because God sent me before you to preserve life. 6 For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are still five years in which there shall neither be tillage nor harvest. 7 And God sent me before you to preserve for you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 8 So now it was not you who sent me here, but God. And he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 9 Hasten, return to my father, and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph: "God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Do not delay. 10 And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen and you shall be near to me—you, your children, your children's children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. 11 And there I will nourish you (for there are still five years of famine), lest you, your household, and all that you have should come to poverty."' 12 And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that speaks to you. 13 And you shall tell my father about all my glory in Egypt and about all that you have seen. And you shall hasten and bring down my father here." 14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 15 Moreover, he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. And afterward, his brothers talked with him.

16 And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, "Joseph's brothers have come." And it pleased Pharaoh and his servants. 17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go, return to the land of Canaan, 18 And take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.' 19 Now you are commanded, 'Do this: take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come. 20 Also, do not regard your belongings, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"

21 And the children of Israel did so. And Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 22 To all of them he gave each man changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing. 23 And to his father he sent after this manner: ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt and ten female donkeys laden with grain, bread, and food for his father on the way.

24 So he sent his brothers away and they departed. And he said to them, "See that you do not contend on the way." 25 And they went up from Egypt and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father, 26 And told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive and he is governor over all the land of Egypt." And Jacob's heart fainted, for he did not believe them. 27 And they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said to them. And when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived. 28 And Israel said, "It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."

1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 2 And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob." And he said, "Here I am." 3 And he said, "I am God, the God of your father. Do not fear to go down into Egypt. For I will make you a great nation there. 4 I will go down with you into Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again. And Joseph shall put his hand upon your eyes."

5 And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba. And the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 6 And they took their livestock and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt—Jacob and all his family with him: 7 His sons and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters. He brought all his family with him into Egypt.

8 And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt—Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born. 9 And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 10 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. 11 And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 12 And the sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Pharez, and Zerah, but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. 13 And the sons of Issachar: Tola, Phuvah, Job, and Shimron. 14 And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 15 These are the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three. 16 And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggai, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 17 And the sons of Asher: Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, and Beriah. Serah was their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter. And these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls. 19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 20 And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him. 21 And the sons of Benjamin: Belah, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 22 These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob. All the souls were fourteen. 23 And the son of Dan: Hushim. 24 And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob. All the souls were seven. 26 All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were sixty-six. 27 And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two souls.

28 And he sent Judah before him to Joseph to direct his face to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen. 29 And Joseph made ready his chariot and went to meet Israel his father at Goshen. And he presented himself to him, fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 30 And Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die since I have seen your face, because you are still alive." 31 And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's house, "I will go up and show Pharaoh, and say to him, 'My brothers and my father's house who were in the land of Canaan have come to me. 32 And the men are shepherds, for their employment has been to feed livestock. And they have brought their flocks, their herds, and all that they have.' 33 And it shall come to pass when Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?' 34 You shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now—both we and also our fathers,' so that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."

_Joseph presents his father and five of his brothers before Pharaoh, 1-10. He gives them habitation and maintenance, 11, 12. He gets the Egyptians' money, 13-16; their livestock, 16, 17; and their lands, except the priests', for Pharaoh, 18-22. He restores the land for a fifth, 23-26. Jacob's age, 28. He charges Joseph to bury him with his fathers, 29-31._

1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, "My father and my brothers, their flocks, their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan, and behold, they are in the land of Goshen." 2 And he took some of his brothers, even five men, and presented them to Pharaoh. 3 And Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?" And they said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds—both we and also our fathers." 4 They said moreover to Pharaoh, "We have come to sojourn in the land, for your servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen." 5 And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, "Your father and your brothers have come to you. 6 The land of Egypt is before you. In the best of the land make your father and brothers to dwell. In the land of Goshen let them dwell. And if you know any able men among them, then make them rulers over my livestock."

7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 8 And Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How old are you?" 9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, nor have they attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage." 10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from before Pharaoh. 11 And Joseph placed his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 12 And Joseph nourished his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with bread, according to their families.

13 And there was no bread in all the land, for the famine was very distressing so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. 14 And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us bread. For why should we die in your presence? For the money fails." 16 And Joseph said, "Give your livestock and I will give you food for your livestock, if money has failed." 17 And they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, for the flocks, for the livestock of the herds, and for the donkeys. And he fed them with bread for all their livestock for that year. 18 When that year had ended, they came to him the second year and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord how our money is spent. My lord also has our herds of livestock. There is not anything left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands. 19 Why shall we die before your eyes—both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed so that we may live and not die, so that the land may not be desolate."

20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians each sold his field because the famine prevailed over them. So the land became Pharaoh's. 21 And as for the people, he moved them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof. 22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a portion assigned to them by Pharaoh and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them; therefore, they did not sell their lands. 23 Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. 24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that you shall give the fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for those of your households, and for food for your little ones." 25 And they said, "You have saved our lives. Let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants." 26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which did not become Pharaoh's.

27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen. And they had possessions in it and grew and multiplied exceedingly. 28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years. So the whole age of Jacob was one hundred and forty-seven years.

29 And the time drew near that Israel must die. And he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If now I have found grace in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me. Do not bury me, I pray you, in Egypt. 30 But I will lie with my fathers. And you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying-place." And he said, "I will do as you have said." [[gen047-031]]31 And he said, "Swear to me." And he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.

[.outline.text-center]
_Joseph and his sons visit his sick father, 1. Jacob strengthens himself to bless them, 2. He repeats God's promise, 3, 4. He takes Ephraim and Manasseh as his own sons, 5, 6. He tells Joseph about his mother's grave, 7. He blesses Ephraim and Manasseh, 8-16. He prefers the younger before the elder, 17-20. He prophesies their return to Canaan, 21, 22._

1 And it came to pass after these things, that someone told Joseph, "Behold, your father is sick." And he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 2 And someone told Jacob, and said, "Behold, your son Joseph comes to you." And Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed. 3 And Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, 4 And said to me, 'Behold I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make you into a multitude of people, and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.' 5 And now, your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt, before I came to you into Egypt, are mine. As Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 6 And your family, which you beget after them, shall be yours and shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance. 7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan, on the way when there was only a little distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way of Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem)."

8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons and said, "Who are these?" 9 And Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given to me in this place." And he said, "Bring them, I pray you, to me and I will bless them." 10 (Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age so that he could not see.) And he brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them. 11 And Israel said to Joseph, "I had not thought to see your face, and behold, God has shown me your children also." 12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him. 14 And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands by design, for Manasseh was the first-born. 15 And he blessed Joseph, and said,

17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. And he lifted his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. 18 And Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father. For this is the first-born. Put your right hand upon his head." 19 And his father refused and said, "I know it, my son, I know it. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great, but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he is, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations."20 And he blessed them that day, saying,

And he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 21 And Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I die, but God shall be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers. 22 Moreover, I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."

28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel. And this is that which their father spoke to them and blessed them. Each according to his blessing he blessed them. 29 And he charged them and said to them, "I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite as a possession for a burying-place. 31 (There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah.) 32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is in it was from the children of Heth." 33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and expired, and was gathered to his people.

_The mourning for Jacob, 1-3. Joseph gets leave of Pharaoh to go to bury him, 4-6. The funeral, 7-14. Joseph comforts his brothers who crave his pardon, 15-21. His age, 22. He sees the third generation of his sons, 23. He prophesies to his brothers of their return, 24. He takes an oath of them concerning his bones, 25. He dies and is put into a coffin, 26._

1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him. 2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel. 3 And forty days were fulfilled for him (for thus they fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed), and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.

4 And when the days of his mourning had past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 5 'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I die. In my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me." Now therefore, let me go, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come back.'" 6 And Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, according as he made you swear."

7 And Joseph went up to bury his father. And with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt, 8 All the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen. 9 And both chariots and horsemen went with him. And it was a very great company. 10 And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation. And he made a mourning for his father seven days. 11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians." Therefore, its name was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.

12 And his sons did to him according as he commanded them. 13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah near Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field as a possession for a burying-place from Ephron the Hittite. 14 And Joseph returned to Egypt—he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father—after he had buried his father.

15 And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "Joseph will perhaps hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him." 16 And they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, "Your father commanded before he died, saying, 17 'Thus you shall say to Joseph: "Forgive, I pray you now, the trespass of your brothers and their sin, for they did evil to you."' And now, we pray you, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father." And Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 18 And his brothers also went and fell down before his face, and they said, "Behold, we are your servants." 19 And Joseph said to them, "Do not fear. For am I in the place of God? 20 But as for you, you thought evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive. 21 Now therefore, do not fear. I will nourish you and your little ones." And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.

22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt—he and his father's house. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. 23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph's knees. 24 And Joseph said to his brothers, "I die, but God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob." 25 And Joseph made the children of Israel take an oath, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here." 26 So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old. And they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
