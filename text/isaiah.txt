== The Vision of Isaiah

*Isaiah | Ἡσαΐας | ישעיהו*

[#isa001%breakable]
=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_Isaiah gives an accusation against Judah for her rebellion, 1-4. He laments her judgments, 5-9. He upbraids their whole service, 10-15. He exhorts to repentance with promises and threatenings, 16-20. Bewailing their wickedness, he denounces God's judgments, 21-24. He promises grace, 25-27; and threatens destruction to the wicked, 28-31._

1 [_The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah._]

2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth. [.linebr]#/# +
For the LORD has spoken, [.linebr]#/# +
"I have nourished and brought up children, [.linebr]#/# +
and they have rebelled against me.

3 The ox knows his owner [.linebr]#/# +
and the donkey his master's crib, [.linebr]#/# +
but Israel does not know, [.linebr]#/# +
my people do not consider."

4 Ah, sinful nation, [.linebr]#/# +
a people laden with iniquity, [.linebr]#/# +
offspring of evil-doers, [.linebr]#/# +
children who are corrupters. [.linebr]#/# +
They have forsaken the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
They have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger. [.linebr]#/# +
They have gone away backward.

5 Why should you be stricken anymore? [.linebr]#/# +
You will revolt more and more. [.linebr]#/# +
The whole head is sick [.linebr]#/# +
and the whole heart is faint.

6 From the sole of the foot even to the head [.linebr]#/# +
there is no soundness in it, [.linebr]#/# +
but wounds, bruises, and putrefying sores. [.linebr]#/# +
They have not been closed, neither bound up, [.linebr]#/# +
neither mollified with ointment.

7 Your country is desolate. [.linebr]#/# +
Your cities are burned with fire. [.linebr]#/# +
Your land, strangers devour it in your presence [.linebr]#/# +
and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

8 And the daughter of Zion is left [.linebr]#/# +
like a cottage in a vineyard, [.linebr]#/# +
like a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, [.linebr]#/# +
like a besieged city.

[[isa001-009]]9 Unless the LORD of hosts [.linebr]#/# +
had left to us a very small remnant, [.linebr]#/# +
we should have been like Sodom, [.linebr]#/# +
we should have been like Gomorrah.

10 Hear the word of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
rulers of Sodom. [.linebr]#/# +
Give ear to the law of our God, [.linebr]#/# +
people of Gomorrah.

11 The LORD says, [.linebr]#/# +
"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? [.linebr]#/# +
I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams [.linebr]#/# +
and the fat of fed beasts, [.linebr]#/# +
and I do not delight in the blood [.linebr]#/# +
of bulls, of lambs, or of male goats.

12 When you come to appear before me, [.linebr]#/# +
who has required this at your hand [.linebr]#/# +
to tread my courts?

13 Bring no more vain oblations. [.linebr]#/# +
Incense is an abomination to me. [.linebr]#/# +
The new moons and sabbaths, [.linebr]#/# +
the calling of assemblies, [.linebr]#/# +
I cannot endure. [.linebr]#/# +
It is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.

14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts [.linebr]#/# +
my soul hates. [.linebr]#/# +
They are a trouble to me. [.linebr]#/# +
I am weary to bear them.

15 And when you spread forth your hands, [.linebr]#/# +
I will hide my eyes from you. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, when you make many prayers, [.linebr]#/# +
I will not hear. [.linebr]#/# +
Your hands are full of blood.

16 Wash, make yourselves clean. [.linebr]#/# +
Put away the evil of your doings [.linebr]#/# +
from before my eyes. [.linebr]#/# +
Cease to do evil.

17 Learn to do well. [.linebr]#/# +
Seek judgment. Relieve the oppressed. [.linebr]#/# +
Judge the fatherless. Plead for the widow.

18 "Come now and let us reason together," says the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
"Though your sins are like scarlet, [.linebr]#/# +
they shall be white as snow. [.linebr]#/# +
Though they are red like crimson, [.linebr]#/# +
they shall be like wool.

19 If you are willing and obedient, [.linebr]#/# +
you shall eat the good of the land,

20 But if you refuse and rebel, [.linebr]#/# +
you shall be devoured with the sword, [.linebr]#/# +
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it."

21 How the faithful city [.linebr]#/# +
has become a harlot! [.linebr]#/# +
It was full of judgment [.linebr]#/# +
and righteousness lodged in it, [.linebr]#/# +
but now murderers.

22 Your silver has become dross [.linebr]#/# +
and your wine mixed with water.

23 Your princes are rebellious [.linebr]#/# +
and companions of thieves. [.linebr]#/# +
Everyone loves gifts [.linebr]#/# +
and follows after rewards. [.linebr]#/# +
They do not judge the fatherless, [.linebr]#/# +
neither does the cause of the widow come to them.

24 Therefore, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +
the mighty One of Israel, says, [.linebr]#/# +
"Ah, I will ease myself of my adversaries [.linebr]#/# +
and avenge myself of my enemies.

25 And I will turn my hand upon you [.linebr]#/# +
and thoroughly purge away your dross [.linebr]#/# +
and take away all your tin.

26 And I will restore your judges as at the first [.linebr]#/# +
and your counselors as at the beginning. [.linebr]#/# +
Afterward, you shall be called, [.linebr]#/# +
The City of Righteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
The Faithful City."

27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment [.linebr]#/# +
and her converts with righteousness.

28 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners [.linebr]#/# +
shall be together, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who forsake the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
shall be consumed.

29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks [.linebr]#/# +
which you have desired, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall be confounded because of the gardens [.linebr]#/# +
that you have chosen.

30 For you shall be like an oak whose leaf fades [.linebr]#/# +
and like a garden that has no water.

31 And the strong shall be like tow [.linebr]#/# +
and its maker like a spark, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall both burn together, [.linebr]#/# +
and no one shall quench them.

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_Isaiah prophesies the coming of Christ's kingdom, 1-5. Wickedness is the cause of God's forsaking, 6-9. He exhorts to fear because of the powerful effects of God's majesty, 10-22._

1 [_The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem._]

2 And it shall come to pass in the last days, [.linebr]#/# +
that the mountain of the LORD'S house [.linebr]#/# +
shall be established on the top of the mountains [.linebr]#/# +
and shall be exalted above the hills. [.linebr]#/# +
And all nations shall flow to it.

3 And many people shall go and say, [.linebr]#/# +
"Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
to the house of the God of Jacob. [.linebr]#/# +
And he will teach us his ways, [.linebr]#/# +
and we will walk in his paths." [.linebr]#/# +
For out of Zion the law shall go forth, [.linebr]#/# +
and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

4 And he will judge among the nations [.linebr]#/# +
and will rebuke many people. [.linebr]#/# +
And they shall beat their swords into plow-shares [.linebr]#/# +
and their spears into pruning-hooks. [.linebr]#/# +
Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall they learn war anymore.

5 O house of Jacob, come, and let us walk [.linebr]#/# +
in the light of the LORD.

6 Therefore, you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
because they are replenished from the east [.linebr]#/# +
and are soothsayers like the Philistines, [.linebr]#/# +
and they please themselves in the children of strangers.

7 Their land is also full of silver and gold, [.linebr]#/# +
neither is there any end of their treasures. [.linebr]#/# +
Their land is also full of horses, [.linebr]#/# +
neither is there any end of their chariots.

8 Their land is also full of idols. [.linebr]#/# +
They worship the work of their own hands, [.linebr]#/# +
that which their own fingers have made.

9 And the common man bows down, [.linebr]#/# +
and the great man humbles himself; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, do not forgive them.

[[isa002-010]]10 Enter into the rock [.linebr]#/# +
and hide in the dust, [.linebr]#/# +
for fear of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and for the glory of his majesty.

11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled [.linebr]#/# +
and the haughtiness of men shall be abased, [.linebr]#/# +
and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.

12 For the day of the LORD of hosts [.linebr]#/# +
shall be upon everyone who is proud and lofty, [.linebr]#/# +
and upon everyone who is lifted up [.linebr]#/# +
(and he shall be brought low),

13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon [.linebr]#/# +
that are high and lifted up [.linebr]#/# +
and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

14 And upon all the high mountains [.linebr]#/# +
and upon all the hills that are lifted up,

15 And upon every high tower [.linebr]#/# +
and upon every fortified wall,

16 And upon all the ships of Tarshish [.linebr]#/# +
and upon all pleasant pictures.

17 And the loftiness of man shall be abased, [.linebr]#/# +
and the haughtiness of men shall be made low. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.

18 And he will utterly abolish the idols.

[[isa002-019]]19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks [.linebr]#/# +
and into the caves of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
for fear of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and for the glory of his majesty, [.linebr]#/# +
when he arises to shake the earth terribly.

20 In that day a man shall cast [.linebr]#/# +
his idols of silver and his idols of gold, [.linebr]#/# +
which they made each one for himself to worship, [.linebr]#/# +
to the moles and to the bats.

[[isa002-021]]21 And they shall go into the clefts of the rocks [.linebr]#/# +
and into the tops of the ragged rocks, [.linebr]#/# +
for fear of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and for the glory of his majesty, [.linebr]#/# +
when he arises to shake the earth terribly.

22 Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils. [.linebr]#/# +
For what is he to be accounted of?

_The great calamities which come by sin, 1-9. The different reward of the righteous and wicked, 10, 11. The oppression and covetousness of the rulers, 12-15. The judgments which shall be for the pride of the women, 16-24. The general desolation, 25, 26._

|1 For behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +
takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah [.linebr]#/# +
the rod and the staff, [.linebr]#/# +
the whole support of bread, [.linebr]#/# +
the whole support of water,

|
|2 The mighty man, the man of war, [.linebr]#/# +
the judge, the prophet, [.linebr]#/# +
the prudent, the ancient,

|
|3 The captain of fifty, the honorable man, [.linebr]#/# +
the counselor, the skillful craftsman, [.linebr]#/# +
and the eloquent orator.

|
|4 And I will give children to be their princes, [.linebr]#/# +
and babies shall rule over them.

|
|5 And the people shall be oppressed, [.linebr]#/# +
each by another and each by his neighbor. [.linebr]#/# +
The child shall behave himself proudly against the elder, [.linebr]#/# +
and the base against the honorable.

|
|6 When a man takes hold of his brother [.linebr]#/# +
of the house of his father, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
"You have clothing. [.linebr]#/# +
Be our ruler. [.linebr]#/# +
And let this ruin be under your hand,"

|
|7 In that day he shall swear, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
"I will not be a healer, [.linebr]#/# +
for in my house there is neither bread nor clothing. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not make me a ruler of the people."

|
|8 For Jerusalem is ruined, [.linebr]#/# +
and Judah has fallen, [.linebr]#/# +
because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
to provoke the eyes of his glory.

|
|9 The show of their countenance witnesses against them. [.linebr]#/# +
They declare their sin like Sodom. [.linebr]#/# +
They do not hide it. [.linebr]#/# +
Woe to their soul! [.linebr]#/# +
For they have rewarded evil to themselves.

|
|10 Say to the righteous that it shall be well with him, [.linebr]#/# +
for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

|
|11 Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him, [.linebr]#/# +
for the reward of his hands shall be given to him.

|
|12 As for my people, children are their oppressors [.linebr]#/# +
and women rule over them. [.linebr]#/# +
O my people, those who lead you cause you to err [.linebr]#/# +
and destroy the way of your paths.

|
|13 The LORD stands up to plead [.linebr]#/# +
and stands to judge the people.

|
|14 The LORD will enter into judgment [.linebr]#/# +
with the elders of his people and with their princes: [.linebr]#/# +
"For you have eaten up the vineyard. [.linebr]#/# +
The plunder of the poor is in your houses."

|
|15 The Lord GOD of hosts says, [.linebr]#/# +
"What do you mean that you beat my people to pieces [.linebr]#/# +
and grind the faces of the poor?"

|
|16 Moreover, the LORD says, [.linebr]#/# +
"Because the daughters of Zion are haughty [.linebr]#/# +
and walk with extended necks [.linebr]#/# +
and wanton eyes, [.linebr]#/# +
walking with short steps as they go [.linebr]#/# +
and making a tinkling with their feet,

|
|17 Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab [.linebr]#/# +
the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, [.linebr]#/# +
and the LORD will uncover their secret parts."
|===

18 In that day the Lord will take away the show of their tinkling ornaments around their feet, their headwear, their crescents, 19 The chains, the bracelets, the veils, 20 The caps, the ornaments of the legs, the head-bands, the perfume boxes, the amulets, 21 The rings, the nose-jewels, 22 The changeable suits of apparel, the mantles, the cloaks, the purses, 23 The mirrors, the fine linen, the hoods, and the veils.

24 And it shall come to pass, that,

and burning instead of beauty.

Only let us be called by your name [.linebr]#/# +
to take away our reproach."

2 In that day the Branch of the LORD shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be for beauty and glory for those of Israel who have escaped. 3 And it shall come to pass, that he who is left in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem. 4 When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and has purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning, 5 The LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night, for upon all the glory there shall be a defense. 6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the day-time from the heat, for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_Under the parable of a vineyard, God excuses his severe judgment, 1-7. His judgments upon covetousness, 8-10; upon lasciviousness, 11, 12; upon impiety, 13-19; and upon injustice, 20-25. The executioners of God's judgments, 26-30._

1 Now I will sing to my well-beloved [.linebr]#/# +
a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. [.linebr]#/# +
My well-beloved has a vineyard [.linebr]#/# +
on a very fruitful hill.

2 And he fenced it, gathered out its stones, [.linebr]#/# +
planted it with the choicest vine, [.linebr]#/# +
built a tower in the midst of it, [.linebr]#/# +
and made a wine-press therein. [.linebr]#/# +
And he expected that it would bring forth grapes, [.linebr]#/# +
and it brought forth wild grapes.

3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, [.linebr]#/# +
judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.

4 What more could have been done to my vineyard [.linebr]#/# +
that I have not done in it? [.linebr]#/# +
Why, when I expected that it would bring forth grapes, [.linebr]#/# +
did it bring forth wild grapes?

5 And now come. I will tell you [.linebr]#/# +
what I will do to my vineyard. [.linebr]#/# +
I will take away its hedge [.linebr]#/# +
and it shall be eaten up, [.linebr]#/# +
and break down its wall [.linebr]#/# +
and it shall be trodden down.

6 And I will lay it waste. [.linebr]#/# +
It shall not be pruned nor dug, [.linebr]#/# +
but there shall come up briers and thorns. [.linebr]#/# +
I will also command the clouds [.linebr]#/# +
that they rain no rain upon it.

7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
and the men of Judah his pleasant plant. [.linebr]#/# +
And he looked for judgment, but behold oppression, [.linebr]#/# +
for righteousness, but behold a cry.

8 Woe to those who join house to house, [.linebr]#/# +
who lay field to field [.linebr]#/# +
until there is no place and you have been placed [.linebr]#/# +
alone in the midst of the earth!

9 In my ears the LORD of hosts said, [.linebr]#/# +
"Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, [.linebr]#/# +
even great and fair, without inhabitant.

10 Even ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, [.linebr]#/# +
and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah."

11 Woe to those who rise early in the morning [.linebr]#/# +
so that they may follow strong drink, [.linebr]#/# +
who continue until night [.linebr]#/# +
until wine inflames them!

12 And the harp, the psaltery, the tambourine, pipe, [.linebr]#/# +
and wine are in their feasts, [.linebr]#/# +
but they do not regard the work of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
neither consider the operation of his hands.

13 Therefore, my people have gone into captivity [.linebr]#/# +
because they have no knowledge. [.linebr]#/# +
And their honorable men are famished [.linebr]#/# +
and their multitude dried up with thirst.

14 Therefore, hell has enlarged herself [.linebr]#/# +
and opened her mouth without measure. [.linebr]#/# +
And their glory, their multitude, their pomp, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who rejoices shall descend into it.

15 And man shall be brought down, [.linebr]#/# +
the mighty man shall be humbled, [.linebr]#/# +
and the eyes of the lofty shall be abased.

16 But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, [.linebr]#/# +
and God who is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.

17 Then the lambs shall feed after their manner, [.linebr]#/# +
and strangers shall eat in the waste places of the fat ones.

18 Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity [.linebr]#/# +
and sin as with a cart-rope,

19 Who say, "Let him make speed and hasten his work [.linebr]#/# +
so that we may see it. [.linebr]#/# +
And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come [.linebr]#/# +
so that we may know it!"

20 Woe to those who call evil good [.linebr]#/# +
and good evil, [.linebr]#/# +
who put darkness for light [.linebr]#/# +
and light for darkness, [.linebr]#/# +
who put bitter for sweet [.linebr]#/# +
and sweet for bitter!

21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes [.linebr]#/# +
and prudent in their own sight!

22 Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine [.linebr]#/# +
and men of strength to mingle strong drink,

23 Who justify the wicked for reward [.linebr]#/# +
and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!

24 Therefore, as the fire devours the stubble [.linebr]#/# +
and the flame consumes the chaff, [.linebr]#/# +
so their root shall be as rottenness [.linebr]#/# +
and their blossom shall go up as dust, [.linebr]#/# +
because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts [.linebr]#/# +
and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

25 Therefore, the anger of the LORD is kindled against his people, [.linebr]#/# +
and he has stretched forth his hand against them and has smitten them. [.linebr]#/# +
And the hills trembled, [.linebr]#/# +
and their carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets. [.linebr]#/# +
For all this his anger is not turned away, [.linebr]#/# +
but his hand is stretched out still.

26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar [.linebr]#/# +
and will hiss to them from the end of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.

27 None shall be weary nor stumble among them [.linebr]#/# +
and none shall slumber nor sleep, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosened [.linebr]#/# +
nor the latchet of their shoes be broken,

28 Whose arrows are sharp [.linebr]#/# +
and all their bows bent, [.linebr]#/# +
their horses' hooves shall be counted like flint [.linebr]#/# +
and their wheels like a whirlwind.

29 Their roaring shall be like a lion. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall roar like young lions. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall even roar and lay hold of the prey, [.linebr]#/# +
and shall carry it away safe, [.linebr]#/# +
and no one shall deliver it.

30 And in that day they shall roar against them [.linebr]#/# +
like the roaring of the sea. [.linebr]#/# +
And if one looks to the land, [.linebr]#/# +
behold, darkness and sorrow, [.linebr]#/# +
and the light is darkened in its heavens.

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_Isaiah, in a vision of the Lord in his glory, 1-4, being terrified, has his apprehensions removed, 5-7. He offers himself and is sent to show the obstinacy of the people to their desolation, 8-12. A remnant shall be saved, 13._

1 In the year that king Uzziah died I also saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and elevated, and his train filled the temple. 2 Above it stood seraphim. Each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. [[isa006-003]]3 And one cried to another and said,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts. [.linebr]#/# +
The whole earth is full of his glory."
|===

4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with smoke. 5 Then I said,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|"Woe is me! For I am undone [.linebr]#/# +
because I am a man of unclean lips [.linebr]#/# +
and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. [.linebr]#/# +
For my eyes have seen the King, [.linebr]#/# +
the LORD of hosts."
|===

6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. 7 And he laid it upon my mouth and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips, and your iniquity is taken away and your sin purged."

8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here I am. Send me." [[isa006-009]]9 And he said, "Go, and tell this people,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]
|===
|
|'In hearing you hear, but do not understand. [.linebr]#/# +
In seeing you see, but do not perceive.'

|
|[[isa006-010]]10 Make the heart of this people fat, [.linebr]#/# +
make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, [.linebr]#/# +
lest they see with their eyes, [.linebr]#/# +
hear with their ears, [.linebr]#/# +
understand with their heart, [.linebr]#/# +
and convert and be healed."

|
|11 Then I said, "Lord, how long?" And he answered, [.linebr]#/# +
"Until the cities are wasted without inhabitant, [.linebr]#/# +
the houses without man, [.linebr]#/# +
and the land is utterly desolate,

|
|12 And the LORD has moved men far away [.linebr]#/# +
and there is a great forsaking in the midst of the land.

|
|13 And if there is a tenth left in it, [.linebr]#/# +
it shall return and be eaten. [.linebr]#/# +
As a terebinth and as an oak [.linebr]#/# +
whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves, [.linebr]#/# +
so the holy seed shall be its substance."

=== Chapter 7

[.outline.text-center]
_Ahaz, being troubled with fear of Rezin and Pekah, is comforted by Isaiah, 1-9. Ahaz, having liberty to choose a sign and refusing it, has for a sign Christ promised, 10-16. His judgment is prophesied to come by Assyria, 17-25._

1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. 2 And it was told to the house of David, saying, "Syria is confederated with Ephraim." And his heart and the heart of his people shook like trees of the forest shaken by the wind.

3 Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go forth now to meet Ahaz—you and Shear-jashub your son—at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field, 4 And say to him, 'Take heed and be quiet. Do not fear, neither be faint-hearted because of the two tails of these smoking fire-brands—because of the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria and of the son of Remaliah. 5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have taken evil counsel against you, saying, 6 "Let us go up against Judah and harass it, and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal," 7 Thus says the Lord GOD:

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|
|"It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.

|
|8 For the head of Syria is Damascus, [.linebr]#/# +
and the head of Damascus is Rezin. [.linebr]#/# +
And within sixty-five years [.linebr]#/# +
Ephraim shall be broken so that it is not a people.

|
|9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, [.linebr]#/# +
and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. [.linebr]#/# +
If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established."'"
|===

10 Moreover, the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying, 11 "Ask for yourself a sign from the LORD your God. Ask it either in the depth or in the height above." 12 But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, neither will I test the LORD." 13 And he said, "Hear now, O house of David. Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also? [[isa007-014]]14 Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. 15 He shall eat butter and honey, so that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good. 16 For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you abhor shall be forsaken by both her kings.

17 "The LORD will bring upon you, upon your people, and upon your father's house days that have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria."

18 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. 19 And they shall come, and all of them shall rest in the desolate valleys, in the holes of the rocks, upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.

20 In the same day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired from beyond the river (namely, by the king of Assyria) the head and the hair of the feet. And it shall also consume the beard.

21 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep. 22 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give, he shall eat butter. For everyone who is left in the land shall eat butter and honey.

23 And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand pieces of silver, it shall even be for briers and thorns. 24 Men shall come there with arrows and with bows, because all the land shall become briers and thorns. 25 And on all hills that are dug with the mattock, the fear of briers and thorns shall not come there, but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of sheep.

_In Maher-shalal-hash-baz, he prophesies that Syria and Israel shall be subdued by Assyria, 1-4. Judah likewise for their infidelity, 5-8. God's judgments shall be irresistible, 9, 10. Comfort shall be to those who fear God, 11-18. Great afflictions to idolaters, 19-22._

1 Moreover, the LORD said to me, "Take a great scroll and write in it with a man's pen, 'Maher-shalal-hash-baz.'" 2 And I took for myself faithful witnesses to record: Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. 3 And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 4 For before the child has knowledge to cry, 'My father,' and, 'My mother,' the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria."

5 The LORD also spoke to me again, saying,

[cols="7%,93%",grid=none,frame=none]

|
|6 "Because this people refuses [.linebr]#/# +
the waters of Shiloah that flow gently [.linebr]#/# +
and rejoices in Rezin and Remaliah's son,

|
|7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon them [.linebr]#/# +
the waters of the river, strong and many, [.linebr]#/# +
even the king of Assyria and all his glory. [.linebr]#/# +
And he shall come up over all its channels [.linebr]#/# +

He shall overflow and go over. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall reach even to the neck. [.linebr]#/# +

And give ear, all you of far countries. [.linebr]#/# +
Gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces. [.linebr]#/# +
Gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces.

|
|10 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nothing. [.linebr]#/# +
Speak the word, and it shall not stand, [.linebr]#/# +

11 For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,

|
|[[isa008-012]]12 "Do not say, 'A confederacy,' [.linebr]#/# +
to all those to whom this people shall say, 'A confederacy,' [.linebr]#/# +
neither fear their fear, nor be afraid.

|
|[[isa008-013]]13 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself, [.linebr]#/# +
and let him be your fear and let him be your dread.

|
|[[isa008-014]]14 And he will be for a sanctuary, [.linebr]#/# +
but for a stone of stumbling [.linebr]#/# +
and for a rock of offense [.linebr]#/# +
to both the houses of Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
for a trap and for a snare [.linebr]#/# +
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

|
|15 And many among them shall stumble, [.linebr]#/# +
fall, be broken, [.linebr]#/# +
be ensnared, and be taken."
|===

16 Bind up the testimony. Seal the law among my disciples. [[isa008-017]]17 And I will wait upon the LORD, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. [[isa008-018]]18 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts who dwells on mount Zion.

19 And when they say to you, "Seek those who have familiar spirits and wizards who peep and mutter," should a people not seek their God? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living? 20 To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. 21 And they shall pass through it distressed and hungry. And it shall come to pass, that when they are hungry, they shall fret themselves and curse their king and their God and look upward. 22 And they shall look to the earth, and behold, trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish, and they shall be driven to darkness.

I have also called my mighty ones for my anger, [.linebr]#/# +
even those who rejoice in my highness.

like that of a great multitude. [.linebr]#/# +
Listen, the uproar of the kingdoms [.linebr]#/# +
of nations gathered together. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD of hosts musters [.linebr]#/# +
the host of the battle.

5 They come from a far country, [.linebr]#/# +
from the end of heaven, [.linebr]#/# +
even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, [.linebr]#/# +
to destroy the whole land.

6 Howl, for the day of the LORD is at hand. [.linebr]#/# +
It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.

7 Therefore, all hands shall be faint, [.linebr]#/# +
every man's heart shall melt,

Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall be in pain like a woman who travails. [.linebr]#/# +

Their faces shall be as flames.

9 Behold, the day of the LORD comes, [.linebr]#/# +
cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, [.linebr]#/# +
to lay the land desolate. [.linebr]#/# +
And he will destroy its sinners out of it.

[[isa013-010]]10 For the stars of heaven and its constellations [.linebr]#/# +
shall not give their light. [.linebr]#/# +
The sun shall be darkened in his going forth, [.linebr]#/# +
and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

11 And I will punish the world for their evil [.linebr]#/# +
and the wicked for their iniquity. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease [.linebr]#/# +
and lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold, [.linebr]#/# +
even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.

13 Therefore, I will shake the heavens. [.linebr]#/# +
And the earth shall be shaken out of her place [.linebr]#/# +
in the wrath of the LORD of hosts [.linebr]#/# +
and in the day of his fierce anger.

14 And it shall be like the chased gazelle [.linebr]#/# +
and like a sheep that no man takes up. [.linebr]#/# +
Every man shall turn to his own people [.linebr]#/# +
and flee each to his own land.

15 Everyone who is found shall be thrust through. [.linebr]#/# +
And everyone who is joined to them shall fall by the sword.

16 Their children shall also be dashed to pieces before their eyes. [.linebr]#/# +
Their houses shall be plundered [.linebr]#/# +
and their wives ravished.

17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, [.linebr]#/# +
who shall not regard silver, [.linebr]#/# +
and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

18 Their bows shall also dash the young men to pieces. [.linebr]#/# +
And they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb. [.linebr]#/# +
Their eye shall not spare children.

19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, [.linebr]#/# +
the beauty of the Chaldeans' excellence, [.linebr]#/# +
shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

20 It shall never be inhabited, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.

21 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there, [.linebr]#/# +
and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures. [.linebr]#/# +
Owls shall dwell there, [.linebr]#/# +
and wild goats shall dance there.

22 And the wolves shall cry in their desolate houses, [.linebr]#/# +
and jackals in their pleasant palaces. [.linebr]#/# +
And her time is near to come, [.linebr]#/# +
and her days shall not be prolonged.

Then his yoke shall depart from off them and his burden shall depart from off their shoulders. 26 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth.

2 He has gone up to Bajith and to Dibon, [.linebr]#/# +

Moab shall howl over Nebo and over Medeba. [.linebr]#/# +

3 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth. [.linebr]#/# +
On the tops of their houses and in their streets [.linebr]#/# +
everyone shall howl, weeping abundantly.

4 And Heshbon shall cry, along with Elealeh. [.linebr]#/# +
Their voice shall be heard even to Jahaz; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out. [.linebr]#/# +
His life shall be grievous to him.

5 My heart shall cry out for Moab. [.linebr]#/# +
His fugitives shall flee to Zoar, [.linebr]#/# +
a heifer of three years old. [.linebr]#/# +
For they shall go up the ascent of Luhith with weeping, [.linebr]#/# +
for in the way of Horonaim [.linebr]#/# +
they shall raise a cry of destruction.

6 For the waters of Nimrim are desolate, [.linebr]#/# +
for the herb is withered away, the grass fails, [.linebr]#/# +
there is no green thing.

7 Therefore, the abundance they have gained, [.linebr]#/# +
and that which they have laid up, [.linebr]#/# +
they shall carry away to the brook of the willows.

8 For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab, [.linebr]#/# +
her howling to Eglaim [.linebr]#/# +
and her howling to Beer-elim.

9 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood, [.linebr]#/# +

neither shall there be shouting. [.linebr]#/# +

Pangs have taken hold upon me [.linebr]#/# +

1 Behold, the LORD makes the earth empty, makes it waste, [.linebr]#/# +
turns it upside down, and scatters abroad its inhabitants.

2 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; [.linebr]#/# +
as with the servant, so with his master; [.linebr]#/# +
as with the woman-servant, so with her mistress; [.linebr]#/# +
as with the buyer, so with the seller; [.linebr]#/# +
as with the lender, so with the borrower; [.linebr]#/# +
as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest to him.

3 The land shall be utterly emptied and utterly plundered, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD has spoken this word.

4 The earth mourns and fades away, [.linebr]#/# +
the world languishes and fades away, [.linebr]#/# +
the haughty people of the earth languish.

5 The earth is also defiled under its inhabitants [.linebr]#/# +
because they have transgressed the laws, [.linebr]#/# +
changed the ordinance, [.linebr]#/# +
and broken the everlasting covenant.

6 Therefore, the curse has devoured the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who dwell in it are desolate. [.linebr]#/# +
Therefore, the inhabitants of the earth are burned [.linebr]#/# +
and few men are left.

7 The new wine mourns, the vine languishes, [.linebr]#/# +

8 The mirth of tambourines ceases. [.linebr]#/# +
The noise of those who rejoice ends. [.linebr]#/# +
The joy of the harp ceases.

9 They shall not drink wine with a song. [.linebr]#/# +
Strong drink shall be bitter to those who drink it.

10 The city of confusion is broken down. [.linebr]#/# +
Every house is shut up so that no man may enter.

11 There is a crying for wine in the streets. [.linebr]#/# +
All joy is darkened, [.linebr]#/# +
the mirth of the land is gone.

12 Desolation is left in the city, [.linebr]#/# +

15 Therefore, glorify the LORD in the fires, [.linebr]#/# +

shall fall into the pit, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit [.linebr]#/# +

19 The earth is utterly broken down, [.linebr]#/# +
the earth is entirely dissolved, [.linebr]#/# +
the earth is exceedingly moved.

20 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard [.linebr]#/# +

Its transgression shall be heavy upon it. [.linebr]#/# +
It shall fall and not rise again.

They shall be shut up in the prison, [.linebr]#/# +

7 And he will destroy on this mountain [.linebr]#/# +
the face of the covering cast over all people [.linebr]#/# +

[[isa025-008]]8 He will swallow up death in victory. [.linebr]#/# +

We have waited for him, and he will save us. [.linebr]#/# +
This is the LORD. We have waited for him. [.linebr]#/# +
We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation."

10 For on this mountain the hand of the LORD shall rest, [.linebr]#/# +
and Moab shall be trodden down under him, [.linebr]#/# +
even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.

11 And he will spread forth his hands in the midst of them, [.linebr]#/# +
as he who swims spreads forth his hands to swim. [.linebr]#/# +
And he will bring down their pride together [.linebr]#/# +
with the tricks of their hands.

12 And the fortress of the high fort of your walls [.linebr]#/# +
he will bring down, lay low, [.linebr]#/# +
and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

They are incited to the consideration of God's discreet providence, 23-29._

1 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, [.linebr]#/# +
whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, [.linebr]#/# +
who are on the head of the rich valleys [.linebr]#/# +
of those who are overcome with wine!

2 Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one. [.linebr]#/# +
Like a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, [.linebr]#/# +
like a flood of mighty waters overflowing, [.linebr]#/# +
he shall cast down to the earth with the hand.

3 The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim [.linebr]#/# +
shall be trodden under feet.

4 And the glorious beauty, [.linebr]#/# +
which is on the head of the rich valley, [.linebr]#/# +
shall be a fading flower [.linebr]#/# +
and as the early fruit before the summer, [.linebr]#/# +
which he who looks upon it sees, [.linebr]#/# +
and while it is still in his hand he eats it up.

5 In that day the LORD of hosts will be [.linebr]#/# +
for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty [.linebr]#/# +
to the remnant of his people,

6 And for a spirit of judgment to him who sits in judgment, [.linebr]#/# +
and for strength to those who turn the battle to the gate.

7 But they also have erred through wine, [.linebr]#/# +
and through strong drink are out of the way. [.linebr]#/# +
The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink. [.linebr]#/# +
They are overwhelmed with wine. [.linebr]#/# +
They are out of the way through strong drink. [.linebr]#/# +
They err in vision. They stumble in judgment.

8 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness [.linebr]#/# +
so that there is no clean place.

9 Whom shall he teach knowledge? [.linebr]#/# +
And whom shall he make to understand doctrine? [.linebr]#/# +
Those who are weaned from the milk [.linebr]#/# +
and drawn from the breasts.

10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept, [.linebr]#/# +
line upon line, line upon line, [.linebr]#/# +
here a little, and there a little.

[[isa028-011]]11 For with stammering lips and another language [.linebr]#/# +
he will speak to this people,

[[isa028-012]]12 To whom he said, "This is the rest [.linebr]#/# +
with which you may cause the weary to rest," [.linebr]#/# +
and, "This is the refreshing," [.linebr]#/# +
yet they would not hear.

13 But the word of the LORD was to them, [.linebr]#/# +
precept upon precept, precept upon precept, [.linebr]#/# +
line upon line, line upon line, [.linebr]#/# +
here a little, and there a little, [.linebr]#/# +
so that they might go and fall backward and be broken, [.linebr]#/# +
snared, and taken.

14 Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, you scornful men, [.linebr]#/# +
who rule this people which is in Jerusalem.

15 Because you have said, [.linebr]#/# +
"We have made a covenant with death [.linebr]#/# +
and we are in agreement with hell. [.linebr]#/# +
When the overflowing scourge passes through, [.linebr]#/# +
it shall not reach us, [.linebr]#/# +
for we have made lies our refuge, [.linebr]#/# +
and under falsehood we have hid ourselves,"

[[isa028-016]]16 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold, I lay a stone in Zion for a foundation, [.linebr]#/# +
a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation. [.linebr]#/# +
He who believes shall not make haste.

17 I will also lay judgment to the line [.linebr]#/# +
and righteousness to the plummet. [.linebr]#/# +
And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, [.linebr]#/# +
and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.

18 And your covenant with death shall be made void, [.linebr]#/# +
and your agreement with hell shall not stand. [.linebr]#/# +
When the overflowing scourge passes through, [.linebr]#/# +
you shall be trodden down by it.

19 From the time that it goes forth it shall take you. [.linebr]#/# +
For morning by morning it shall pass over, [.linebr]#/# +
by day and by night. [.linebr]#/# +
And it shall be a vexation only to understand the report."

20 For the bed is shorter than a man can stretch himself on, [.linebr]#/# +
and the covering narrower than he can wrap himself in.

21 For the LORD will rise as on mount Perazim, [.linebr]#/# +
he will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, [.linebr]#/# +
so that he may do his work, his strange work, [.linebr]#/# +
and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

22 Now therefore, do not be mockers, [.linebr]#/# +
lest your bonds be made strong, [.linebr]#/# +
for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, [.linebr]#/# +
even determined upon the whole earth.

23 Give ear and hear my voice. [.linebr]#/# +
Listen and hear my speech.

24 Does the plowman plow all day to sow? [.linebr]#/# +
Does he open and break the clods of his ground?

25 When he has made even its face, [.linebr]#/# +
does he not cast abroad the vetches, scatter the cumin, [.linebr]#/# +
cast in the principal wheat, the appointed barley, [.linebr]#/# +
and the spelt in their place?

26 For his God instructs him to discretion [.linebr]#/# +
and teaches him.

27 For the vetches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, [.linebr]#/# +
neither is a cart-wheel turned around upon the cumin. [.linebr]#/# +
But the vetches are beaten out with a staff [.linebr]#/# +
and the cumin with a rod.

28 Bread-grain is bruised, [.linebr]#/# +
because he will not always be threshing it, [.linebr]#/# +
nor break it with the wheel of his cart, [.linebr]#/# +
nor bruise it with his horsemen.

29 This also comes forth from the LORD of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +
who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in operation.

At the rebuke of five you shall flee [.linebr]#/# +

You shall cast them away like a polluted cloth. You shall say to it, "Be gone from me."

23 Then he shall give the rain of your seed, with which you shall sow the ground, and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day your livestock shall feed in large pastures. 24 The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that plow the ground shall eat clean provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. 25 And there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. 26 Moreover, the light of the moon shall be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold, like the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD binds up the breach of his people and heals the stroke of their wound.

When you cease to lay waste, [.linebr]#/# +
you shall be wasted, [.linebr]#/# +

2 O LORD, be gracious to us. [.linebr]#/# +
We have waited for you. [.linebr]#/# +
Be their arm every morning [.linebr]#/# +
and our salvation in the time of trouble.

3 At the noise of the tumult the people fled. [.linebr]#/# +
At the lifting up of yourself the nations were scattered.

4 And your plunder shall be gathered [.linebr]#/# +
like the gathering of the ravaging-locust. [.linebr]#/# +
As the running to and fro of locusts [.linebr]#/# +

5 The LORD is exalted, for he dwells on high. [.linebr]#/# +
He has filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.

6 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of your times [.linebr]#/# +

The fear of the LORD is his treasure.

7 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry outside. [.linebr]#/# +

8 The highways lie waste, [.linebr]#/# +

9 The earth mourns and languishes. [.linebr]#/# +
Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down. [.linebr]#/# +
Sharon is like a wilderness. [.linebr]#/# +
And Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.

"Now I will be exalted. [.linebr]#/# +
Now I will lift up myself.

11 You shall conceive chaff. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall bring forth stubble. [.linebr]#/# +
Your breath, like a fire, shall devour you.

12 And the people shall be like the burnings of lime. [.linebr]#/# +
Like thorns cut up they shall be burned in the fire.

13 You who are far off, hear what I have done. [.linebr]#/# +
And you who are near, acknowledge my might."

14 The sinners in Zion are afraid. [.linebr]#/# +
Fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites. [.linebr]#/# +
"Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? [.linebr]#/# +
Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?"

15 He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly, [.linebr]#/# +
he who despises the gain of oppressions, [.linebr]#/# +
who shakes his hands from holding of bribes, [.linebr]#/# +
who stops his ears from hearing about blood [.linebr]#/# +
and shuts his eyes from seeing evil,

16 He shall dwell on high. [.linebr]#/# +
His place of defense shall be the fortresses of rocks. [.linebr]#/# +
Bread shall be given to him. His waters shall be sure.

17 Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall behold the land that is very far off.

18 Your heart shall meditate terror. [.linebr]#/# +
"Where is the scribe? Where is the receiver? [.linebr]#/# +
Where is he who counted the towers?"

19 You shall not see a fierce people, [.linebr]#/# +
a people of deeper speech than you can perceive, [.linebr]#/# +
of a stammering tongue that you cannot understand.

20 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities. [.linebr]#/# +
Your eyes shall see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, [.linebr]#/# +
a tabernacle that shall not be taken down. [.linebr]#/# +
Not one of its stakes shall ever be removed, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall any of its cords be broken.

21 But there the glorious LORD will be for us [.linebr]#/# +
a place of broad rivers and streams, [.linebr]#/# +
in which no galley with oars shall go, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall gallant ship pass through it.

22 For the LORD is our judge. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD is our lawgiver. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD is our king. [.linebr]#/# +
He will save us.

23 Your tacklings are loosened. [.linebr]#/# +
They could not well strengthen their mast. [.linebr]#/# +
They could not spread the sail. [.linebr]#/# +
Then the loot of a great plunder is divided. [.linebr]#/# +
The lame take the plunder.

24 And the inhabitants shall not say, "I am sick." [.linebr]#/# +
The people who dwell therein [.linebr]#/# +
shall have their iniquity forgiven.

And listen, you people. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the earth hear, and all that is in it, [.linebr]#/# +
the world, and all things that spring from it.

2 For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations [.linebr]#/# +

He has utterly destroyed them. [.linebr]#/# +
He has delivered them to the slaughter.

And all their hosts shall fall down [.linebr]#/# +

5 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, it shall come down upon Edom [.linebr]#/# +
and upon the people of my curse to judgment.

6 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood. [.linebr]#/# +
It is made fat with fatness, [.linebr]#/# +
with the blood of lambs and goats, [.linebr]#/# +
with the fat of the kidneys of rams. [.linebr]#/# +
For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah [.linebr]#/# +

7 And the wild oxen shall come down with them, [.linebr]#/# +
and the young bulls with the strong bulls. [.linebr]#/# +
And their land shall be drenched with blood [.linebr]#/# +
and their dust made fat with fatness.

8 For it is the day of the LORD'S vengeance, [.linebr]#/# +
and the year of recompenses [.linebr]#/# +
for the controversy of Zion.

9 And its streams shall be turned into pitch [.linebr]#/# +
and its dust into brimstone, [.linebr]#/# +
and its land shall become burning pitch.

[[isa034-010]]10 It shall not be quenched night or day. [.linebr]#/# +
Its smoke shall ascend forever. [.linebr]#/# +
From generation to generation it shall lie waste. [.linebr]#/# +
None shall pass through it forever and ever.

11 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it. [.linebr]#/# +
The owl and the raven shall dwell in it. [.linebr]#/# +
And he shall stretch out upon it [.linebr]#/# +
the line of confusion and the stones of emptiness.

12 They shall call her nobles to the kingdom, [.linebr]#/# +
but no one shall be there, [.linebr]#/# +
and all her princes shall be nothing.

13 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, [.linebr]#/# +
nettles and brambles in her fortresses, [.linebr]#/# +
and it shall be a habitation of jackals [.linebr]#/# +
and a court for owls.

14 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wolves, [.linebr]#/# +
and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow. [.linebr]#/# +
The screech-owl shall also rest there [.linebr]#/# +
and find for herself a place of rest.

15 There the great owl shall make her nest, lay, [.linebr]#/# +
and hatch and gather under her shadow. [.linebr]#/# +
There the vultures shall also be gathered, [.linebr]#/# +

16 Seek out of the book of the LORD, and read. [.linebr]#/# +
Not one of these shall fail. [.linebr]#/# +
Not one shall lack her mate. [.linebr]#/# +
For my mouth has commanded, [.linebr]#/# +

17 And he has cast the lot for them, [.linebr]#/# +
and his hand has divided it to them by line. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall possess it forever. [.linebr]#/# +
From generation to generation they shall dwell therein.

_Sennacherib invades Judah, 1. Rabshakeh, sent by Sennacherib, by blasphemous persuasions solicits the people to revolt, 2-21. His words are told to Hezekiah, 22._

1 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them. 2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem against king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field. 3 Then Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was over the house, Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son the recorder, came forth to him.

4 And Rabshakeh said to them, "Say now to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: "What confidence is this in which you trust? 5 You say (but they are only vain words), 'I have counsel and strength for the war.' Now in whom do you trust that you rebel against me? 6 Behold, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will enter his hand and pierce it. Thus Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all who trust in him. 7 But if you say to me, 'We trust in the LORD our God,' is it not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar'? 8 Now therefore, give pledges, I pray you, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you can on your part set riders upon them. 9 How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 10 And have I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'"'"

11 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it. And do not speak to us in the Jew's language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall." 12 But Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men who sit upon the wall, who will have to devour their vilest excretions with you?"

13 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jew's language and said, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 14 Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you, 15 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us. This city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria." 16 Do not listen to Hezekiah,' for thus says the king of Assyria: 'Make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me. And each of you eat from his vine, and each from his fig-tree, and each of you drink the waters from his own cistern 17 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 18 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, "The LORD will deliver us." Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 20 Who are they among all the gods of these lands, who have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"

21 But they held their peace and did not answer him a word, for the king's commandment was, saying, "Do not answer him." 22 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

_Hezekiah, mourning, sends to Isaiah to pray for them, 1-5. Isaiah comforts them, 6, 7. Sennacherib, going to encounter Tirhakah, sends a blasphemous letter to Hezekiah, 8-13. Hezekiah's prayer, 14-20. Isaiah's prophecy of the pride and destruction of Sennacherib and the good of Zion, 21-35. An angel slays the Assyrians, 36. Sennacherib is slain at Nineveh by his own sons, 37, 38._

1 And it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. 2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 3 And they said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah: 'This day is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of blasphemy, for the children have come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. 4 It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.'"

5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 6 And Isaiah said to them, "Thus you shall say to your master: 'Thus says the LORD: "Do not be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. 7 Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."'"

8 So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish. 9 And he heard it said concerning Tirhakah king of Cush: "He has come forth to make war with you." And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 10 "Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, "Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria." 11 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly. And shall you be delivered? 12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar? 13 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?'"

14 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. And Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD. 15 And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying, 16 "O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, who dwells between the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. 17 Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear. Open your eyes, O LORD, and see. And hear all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to reproach the living God. 18 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries 19 And have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore, they have destroyed them. 20 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are the LORD, even you only."

21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel: 'Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, 22 This is the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him:

30 "And this shall be a sign to you: you shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and the second year that which springs of the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 31 And the remnant of the house of Judah who have escaped shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward. 32 For out of Jerusalem a remnant shall go forth, and out of mount Zion those who escape. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this."'

33 "Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: 'He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a siege-mound against it. 34 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and shall not come into this city,' says the LORD. 35 'For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for my servant David's sake.'"

36 Then the angel of the LORD went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. 37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at Nineveh. 38 And it came to pass as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword, and they escaped into the land of Armenia.

1 In those days Hezekiah was sick with a mortal disease. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, "Thus says the LORD: 'Set your house in order, for you shall die, and not live.'" 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed to the LORD, 3 And said, "Remember now, O LORD, I implore you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.

4 Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying, 5 "Go and say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: "I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add to your days fifteen years. 6 And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. And I will defend this city."'

7 "And this shall be a sign to you from the LORD that the LORD will do this thing that he has spoken: 8 Behold, I will bring back the shadow of the degrees, which has gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward." So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it had gone down.

1 At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 2 And Hezekiah rejoiced over them and showed them the house of his precious things: the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious ointment, all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. 3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah and said to him, "What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?" And Hezekiah said, "They have come to me from a far country, even from Babylon." 4 Then he said, "What have they seen in your house?" And Hezekiah answered, "All that is in my house they have seen. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them."

5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD of hosts: 6 'Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left,' says the LORD. 7 'And of your sons who shall issue from you, which you shall beget, they shall take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'" 8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken."

that her iniquity is pardoned, [.linebr]#/# +
for she has received from the LORD'S hand [.linebr]#/# +
double for all her sins."

[[isa040-003]]3 The voice of him who cries in the wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
"Prepare the way of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Make straight in the desert [.linebr]#/# +
a highway for our God.

[[isa040-004]]4 Every valley shall be exalted, [.linebr]#/# +
every mountain and hill shall be made low, [.linebr]#/# +
the crooked shall be made straight, [.linebr]#/# +
and the rough places plain.

[[isa040-005]]5 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, [.linebr]#/# +
and all flesh together shall see it. [.linebr]#/# +
For the mouth of the LORD has spoken it."

[[isa040-006]]6 The voice said, "Cry." [.linebr]#/# +
And he said, "What shall I cry?" [.linebr]#/# +
All flesh is grass, [.linebr]#/# +
and all its goodliness is as the flower of the field.

7 The grass withers, the flower fades, [.linebr]#/# +
because the spirit of the LORD blows upon it. [.linebr]#/# +
Surely the people are grass.

[[isa040-008]]8 The grass withers, the flower fades, [.linebr]#/# +
but the word of our God shall stand forever.

9 O Zion, who brings good tidings, [.linebr]#/# +
go up upon the high mountain. [.linebr]#/# +
O Jerusalem, who brings good tidings, [.linebr]#/# +
lift up your voice with strength. [.linebr]#/# +
Lift it up, do not be afraid. [.linebr]#/# +
Say to the cities of Judah, [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold your God!"

10 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with a strong hand, [.linebr]#/# +
and his arm will rule for him. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, his reward is with him [.linebr]#/# +
and his work before him.

11 He will feed his flock like a shepherd. [.linebr]#/# +
He will gather the lambs with his arm [.linebr]#/# +
and carry them in his bosom, [.linebr]#/# +
and will gently lead those who are with young.

12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, [.linebr]#/# +
measured heaven with the span, [.linebr]#/# +
comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, [.linebr]#/# +
and weighed the mountains in scales [.linebr]#/# +
and the hills in a balance?

[[isa040-013]]13 Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
or being his counselor has taught him?

14 With whom did he take counsel, [.linebr]#/# +
and who instructed him, [.linebr]#/# +
taught him in the path of judgment, [.linebr]#/# +
taught him knowledge, [.linebr]#/# +
and showed to him the way of understanding?

15 Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket [.linebr]#/# +
and are counted as the small dust on the balance. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, he takes up the islands like a very little thing.

16 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, [.linebr]#/# +
nor its beasts sufficient for a burnt-offering.

17 All nations before him are as nothing, [.linebr]#/# +
and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.

18 To whom then will you compare God? [.linebr]#/# +
Or what likeness will you compare to him?

19 The workman melts an engraved image, [.linebr]#/# +
and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold [.linebr]#/# +
and casts silver chains.

20 He who is so impoverished that he has no oblation [.linebr]#/# +
chooses a tree that will not rot. [.linebr]#/# +
He seeks for himself a skillful workman [.linebr]#/# +
to prepare an engraved image that shall not be moved.

21 Have you not known? Have you not heard? [.linebr]#/# +
Has it not been told to you from the beginning? [.linebr]#/# +
Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?

22 It is he who sits upon the circle of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and its inhabitants are like locusts, [.linebr]#/# +
who stretches out the heavens like a curtain [.linebr]#/# +
and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in,

23 Who brings the princes to nothing. [.linebr]#/# +
He makes the judges of the earth as vanity.

24 They have hardly been planted, [.linebr]#/# +
they have hardly been sown, [.linebr]#/# +
their stock has hardly taken root in the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and then he blows upon them and they wither, [.linebr]#/# +
and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.

25 "To whom then will you compare me, or shall I be equaled?" [.linebr]#/# +
says the Holy One.

26 Lift up your eyes on high [.linebr]#/# +
and behold who has created these things, [.linebr]#/# +
who brings out their host by number. [.linebr]#/# +
He calls them all by name. [.linebr]#/# +
By the greatness of his might [.linebr]#/# +
and because he is strong in power, [.linebr]#/# +
not one fails.

27 Why do you say, O Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
and speak, O Israel, "My way is hid from the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and my judgment is passed over by my God"?

28 Have you not known? Have you not heard, [.linebr]#/# +
that the everlasting God, the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
the Creator of the ends of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
does not faint, neither is weary? [.linebr]#/# +
There is no searching of his understanding.

29 He gives power to the faint, [.linebr]#/# +
and to those who have no might he increases strength.

30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, [.linebr]#/# +
and the young men shall utterly fall,

31 But those who wait upon the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
shall renew their strength. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall mount up with wings like eagles. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall run and not be weary. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall walk and not faint.

=== Chapter 41

[.outline.text-center]
_God expostulates with his people about his mercies to the church, 1-9, about his promises, 10-20, and about the vanity of idols, 21-29._

1 "Keep silence before me, O coastlands, [.linebr]#/# +
and let the people renew their strength. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them come near, then let them speak. [.linebr]#/# +
Let us come near together for judgment.

2 Who raised up the righteous man from the east, [.linebr]#/# +
called him to his foot, [.linebr]#/# +
gave the nations before him, [.linebr]#/# +
and made him rule over kings? [.linebr]#/# +
He gave them as the dust to his sword [.linebr]#/# +
and as driven stubble to his bow.

3 He pursued them and passed safely, [.linebr]#/# +
even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.

4 Who has wrought and done it, [.linebr]#/# +
calling the generations from the beginning? [.linebr]#/# +
I, the LORD, the first [.linebr]#/# +
and with the last, I am he."

5 The coastlands saw it and feared. [.linebr]#/# +
The ends of the earth were afraid, [.linebr]#/# +
drew near, and came.

6 They each helped his neighbor, [.linebr]#/# +
and each said to his brother, [.linebr]#/# +
"Be of good courage."

7 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who smooths with the hammer [.linebr]#/# +
encouraged him who smote the anvil, [.linebr]#/# +
saying, "It is ready for the soldering." [.linebr]#/# +
And he fastened it with nails [.linebr]#/# +
so that it should not be moved.

8 "But you, Israel, are my servant, [.linebr]#/# +
Jacob whom I have chosen, [.linebr]#/# +
the offspring of Abraham my friend,

9 You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth [.linebr]#/# +
and called you from the chief men thereof, [.linebr]#/# +
and said to you, 'You are my servant. [.linebr]#/# +
I have chosen you and not cast you away.'

10 Do not fear, for I am with you. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not be dismayed, for I am your God. [.linebr]#/# +
I will strengthen you and I will even help you. [.linebr]#/# +
I will also uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.

11 Behold, all those who were incensed against you [.linebr]#/# +
shall be ashamed and confounded. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall be as nothing. [.linebr]#/# +
And those who contend with you shall perish.

12 You shall seek them, and shall not find them, [.linebr]#/# +
even those who contended with you. [.linebr]#/# +
Those who war against you [.linebr]#/# +
shall be as nothing, as a thing that does not exist.

13 For I, the LORD your God, [.linebr]#/# +
will hold your right hand, [.linebr]#/# +
saying to you, 'Do not fear. [.linebr]#/# +
I will help you.'

14 Do not fear, you worm Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
and you men of Israel. [.linebr]#/# +
I will help you," says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.

15 Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument [.linebr]#/# +
having teeth. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall thresh the mountains and beat them small, [.linebr]#/# +
and shall make the hills as chaff.

16 You shall fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, [.linebr]#/# +
and the whirlwind shall scatter them. [.linebr]#/# +
And you shall rejoice in the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and glory in the Holy One of Israel.

17 When the poor and needy seek water and there is none, [.linebr]#/# +
and their tongue fails for thirst, [.linebr]#/# +
I, the LORD, will hear them. [.linebr]#/# +
I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.

18 I will open rivers in high places [.linebr]#/# +
and fountains in the midst of the valleys. [.linebr]#/# +
I will make the wilderness a pool of water [.linebr]#/# +
and the dry land springs of water.

19 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, [.linebr]#/# +
the shittah-tree, the myrtle, and the oil-tree. [.linebr]#/# +
I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine, [.linebr]#/# +
and the box-tree together,

20 So that they may see, know, [.linebr]#/# +
consider, and understand together, [.linebr]#/# +
that the hand of the LORD has done this, [.linebr]#/# +
and the Holy One of Israel has created it.

21 Produce your cause," says the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
"Bring forth your strong reasons," says the King of Jacob.

22 "Let them bring them forth and show us [.linebr]#/# +
what shall happen. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them show the former things, what they are, [.linebr]#/# +
so that we may consider them [.linebr]#/# +
and know the latter end of them. [.linebr]#/# +
Or declare to us things to come.

23 Show the things that are to come hereafter [.linebr]#/# +
so that we may know that you are gods. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, do good or do evil [.linebr]#/# +
so that we may be dismayed and behold it together.

24 Behold, you are of nothing, [.linebr]#/# +
and your work is of nothing. [.linebr]#/# +
He who chooses you is an abomination.

25 I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come. [.linebr]#/# +
From the rising of the sun he shall call upon my name. [.linebr]#/# +
And he shall come upon princes as upon mortar, [.linebr]#/# +
and as the potter treads clay.

26 Who has declared from the beginning [.linebr]#/# +
so that we may know, [.linebr]#/# +
and beforehand [.linebr]#/# +
so that we may say, 'He is righteous'? [.linebr]#/# +
Surely, there is no one who shows. [.linebr]#/# +
Surely, there is no one who declares. [.linebr]#/# +
Surely, there is no one who hears your words.

27 The first shall say to Zion, [.linebr]#/# +
'Behold, behold them.' [.linebr]#/# +
And I will give to Jerusalem [.linebr]#/# +
one who brings good tidings.

28 For I beheld, and there was no man, [.linebr]#/# +
even among them, and there was no counselor, [.linebr]#/# +
who, when I asked of them, could answer a word.

29 Behold, they are all vanity. [.linebr]#/# +
Their works are nothing. [.linebr]#/# +
Their molten images are wind and confusion."

[#isa042%breakable]
=== Chapter 42

[.outline.text-center]
_The office of Christ, graced with meekness and constancy, 1-4. God's promise to him, 5-9. An exhortation to praise God for his Gospel, 10-12. God will manifest himself and check idolatry, 13-17. He reproves the people of incredulity, 18-25._

[[isa042-001]]1 "Behold my servant, whom I uphold, [.linebr]#/# +
my elect, in whom my soul delights. [.linebr]#/# +
I have put my Spirit upon him. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.

[[isa042-002]]2 He shall not cry, nor lift up, [.linebr]#/# +
nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.

[[isa042-003]]3 A bruised reed he shall not break, [.linebr]#/# +
and the smoking flax he shall not quench. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall bring forth judgment to truth.

[[isa042-004]]4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged [.linebr]#/# +
until he has set judgment in the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
And the coastlands shall wait for his law."

5 Thus says God the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
he who created the heavens [.linebr]#/# +
and expanded them, [.linebr]#/# +
he who spread forth the earth [.linebr]#/# +
and that which it produces, [.linebr]#/# +
he who gives breath to the people upon it [.linebr]#/# +
and spirit to those who walk therein:

6 "I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will hold your hand. [.linebr]#/# +
I will keep you [.linebr]#/# +
and give you as a covenant to the people, [.linebr]#/# +
as a light to the Gentiles,

7 To open the blind eyes, [.linebr]#/# +
to bring out the prisoners from the prison, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who sit in darkness out of the prison-house.

8 I am the LORD. That is my name. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will not give my glory to another, [.linebr]#/# +
neither my praise to engraved images.

9 Behold, the former things have come to pass, [.linebr]#/# +
and new things I declare. [.linebr]#/# +
Before they spring forth I tell you of them."

10 Sing to the LORD a new song, [.linebr]#/# +
and his praise from the end of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, [.linebr]#/# +
the islands, and their inhabitants.

11 Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice, [.linebr]#/# +
the villages that Kedar inhabits. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the inhabitants of the rock sing. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them shout from the top of the mountains.

12 Let them give glory to the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and declare his praise in the coastlands.

13 The LORD will go forth like a mighty man, [.linebr]#/# +
he will stir up jealousy like a man of war. [.linebr]#/# +
He will cry and even roar. [.linebr]#/# +
He will prevail against his enemies.

14 "I have for a long time held my peace. [.linebr]#/# +
I have been still and restrained myself. [.linebr]#/# +
Now I will cry like a travailing woman. [.linebr]#/# +
I will destroy and devour at once.

15 I will make waste mountains and hills [.linebr]#/# +
and dry up all their herbs. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will make the rivers to be islands, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will dry up the pools.

16 And I will bring the blind by a way that they did not know. [.linebr]#/# +
I will lead them in paths that they have not known. [.linebr]#/# +
I will make darkness light before them, [.linebr]#/# +
and crooked things straight. [.linebr]#/# +
I will do these things for them, [.linebr]#/# +
and not forsake them."

17 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, [.linebr]#/# +
who trust in engraved images, [.linebr]#/# +
who say to the molten images, [.linebr]#/# +
"You are our gods."

18 Hear, you deaf, [.linebr]#/# +
and look, you blind, so that you may see.

19 Who is blind, but my servant, [.linebr]#/# +
or deaf, as my messenger whom I sent? [.linebr]#/# +
Who is blind as he who is perfect, [.linebr]#/# +
and blind as the LORD'S servant?

20 Seeing many things, you do not observe. [.linebr]#/# +
Opening the ears, he does not hear.

21 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake. [.linebr]#/# +
He will magnify the law and make it honorable.

22 But this is a people robbed and pillaged. [.linebr]#/# +
All of them are snared in holes, [.linebr]#/# +
and they are hid in prison-houses. [.linebr]#/# +
They are for plunder, and no one delivers, [.linebr]#/# +
for loot, and no one says, "Restore."

23 Who among you will give ear to this? [.linebr]#/# +
Who will listen and hear for the time to come?

24 Who gave Jacob for plunder and Israel to the robbers? [.linebr]#/# +
Was it not the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
he against whom we have sinned? [.linebr]#/# +
For they would not walk in his ways, [.linebr]#/# +
neither were they obedient to his law.

25 Therefore, he has poured upon him the fury of his anger [.linebr]#/# +
and the strength of battle. [.linebr]#/# +
It has set him on fire around, yet he did not know. [.linebr]#/# +
It burned him, yet he did not lay it to heart.

1 But now thus says the LORD who created you, O Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who formed you, O Israel: [.linebr]#/# +
"Do not fear, for I have redeemed you. [.linebr]#/# +
I have called you by your name. You are mine.

2 When you pass through the waters, [.linebr]#/# +
I will be with you. [.linebr]#/# +
And [when you pass] through the rivers, [.linebr]#/# +
they shall not overflow you. [.linebr]#/# +
When you walk through the fire, [.linebr]#/# +
you shall not be burned, [.linebr]#/# +

3 For I am the LORD your God, [.linebr]#/# +
the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. [.linebr]#/# +
I gave Egypt for your ransom, [.linebr]#/# +
Cush and Seba for you.

4 Since you have been precious in my sight, [.linebr]#/# +
you have been honorable, [.linebr]#/# +

therefore I will give men in your stead [.linebr]#/# +
and people for your life.

5 Do not fear, for I am with you. [.linebr]#/# +
I will bring your offspring from the east [.linebr]#/# +
and gather you from the west.

6 I will say to the north, 'Give up,' [.linebr]#/# +
and to the south, 'Do not keep back.' [.linebr]#/# +
Bring my sons from far [.linebr]#/# +
and my daughters from the ends of the earth,

7 Even everyone who is called by my name, [.linebr]#/# +
for I have created him for my glory. [.linebr]#/# +
I have formed him. Truly, I have made him."

8 Bring forth the blind people who have eyes [.linebr]#/# +
and the deaf who have ears.

9 Let all the nations be collected [.linebr]#/# +
and let the people be assembled. [.linebr]#/# +
Who among them can declare this [.linebr]#/# +
and show us former things? [.linebr]#/# +
Let them bring forth their witnesses [.linebr]#/# +
so that they may be justified. [.linebr]#/# +
Or let them hear, and say, "It is truth."

10 "You are my witnesses," says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"and my servant whom I have chosen, [.linebr]#/# +
so that you may know and believe me [.linebr]#/# +
and understand that I am he. [.linebr]#/# +
Before me there was no god formed, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall there be after me.

11 I, even I, am the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and besides me there is no savior.

12 I have declared, and have saved, [.linebr]#/# +
and I have shown, [.linebr]#/# +
when there was no strange god among you; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, you are my witnesses," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, "that I am God.

13 Even before the day was, I am he. [.linebr]#/# +
And there is no one who can deliver out of my hand. [.linebr]#/# +
I will work, and who shall hinder it?"

14 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, [.linebr]#/# +
the Holy One of Israel: [.linebr]#/# +
"For your sake I have sent to Babylon [.linebr]#/# +
and have brought down all their nobles [.linebr]#/# +
and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.

15 I am the LORD, your Holy One, [.linebr]#/# +
the Creator of Israel, your King."

16 Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea [.linebr]#/# +

17 Who brings forth the chariot and horse, [.linebr]#/# +
the army and the power [.linebr]#/# +
(they shall lie down together, they shall not rise, [.linebr]#/# +
they are extinct, they are quenched like tow):

18 "Do not remember the former things, [.linebr]#/# +
neither consider the things of old.

19 Behold, I will do a new thing. [.linebr]#/# +
Now it shall spring forth. Shall you not know it? [.linebr]#/# +
I will even make a way in the wilderness [.linebr]#/# +
and rivers in the desert.

[[isa043-020]]20 The beast of the field shall honor me, [.linebr]#/# +
the jackals and the owls, [.linebr]#/# +

[[isa043-021]]21 This people I have formed for myself, [.linebr]#/# +

22 Yet you have not called upon me, O Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
but you have been weary of me, O Israel.

23 You have not brought me the sheep of your burnt-offerings, [.linebr]#/# +
neither have you honored me with your sacrifices. [.linebr]#/# +
I have not caused you to serve with an offering, [.linebr]#/# +
nor wearied you with incense.

24 You have bought me no sweet cane with money, [.linebr]#/# +
neither have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices. [.linebr]#/# +
But you have made me to serve with your sins, [.linebr]#/# +
you have wearied me with your iniquities.

25 I, even I, am he [.linebr]#/# +
who blots out your transgressions for my own sake [.linebr]#/# +
and will not remember your sins.

26 Put me in remembrance. Let us plead together. [.linebr]#/# +
Declare, so that you may be justified.

27 Your first father has sinned, [.linebr]#/# +
and your teachers have transgressed against me.

28 Therefore, I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, [.linebr]#/# +
and have given Jacob to the curse [.linebr]#/# +

9 Those who make an engraved image are all of them vanity, and their delectable things shall not profit, and they are their own witnesses. They neither see nor know so that they may be ashamed. 10 Who has formed a god, or cast an engraved image that is profitable for nothing? 11 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed, and the workmen, they are of men. Let them all be assembled. Let them stand up. Yet they shall fear and they shall be ashamed together.

12 The smith with the tongs works in the coals, fashions it with hammers, and works it with the strength of his arms. Indeed, he is hungry and his strength fails. He drinks no water and is faint. 13 The carpenter stretches out his rule. He marks it out with a line. He fits it with planes and marks it out with the compass. He makes it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, so that it may remain in the house. 14 He hews down cedars for himself and takes the cypress and the oak, which he strengthens for himself among the trees of the forest. He plants an ash, and the rain nourishes it. 15 Then it shall be for a man to burn, for he will take some of it and warm himself. Indeed he kindles it and bakes bread. He even makes a god and worships it. He makes it an engraved image and falls down to it. 16 He burns part of it in the fire. With part of it he eats flesh. He roasts meat and is satisfied. Indeed, he warms himself and says, "Aha, I am warm. I have seen the fire." 17 And from the rest of it he makes a god, even his engraved image. He falls down to it, worships it, and prays to it, and says, "Deliver me, for you are my god."

18 They have not known nor understood, for he has shut their eyes so that they cannot see, and their hearts so that they cannot understand. 19 And no one considers in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, "I have burned part of it in the fire. I have also baked bread upon its coals. I have roasted flesh and eaten it. And shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?" 20 He feeds on ashes. A deceived heart has turned him aside so that he cannot deliver his soul, or say, "Is there not a lie in my right hand?"

I have formed you. You are my servant. [.linebr]#/# +
O Israel, you shall not be forgotten by me.

who turns wise men backward [.linebr]#/# +

who says to Jerusalem, 'You shall be inhabited,' [.linebr]#/# +

_God calls Cyrus for his church's sake, 1-4. By his omnipotence he challenges obedience, 5-19. He convinces the idols of vanity by his saving power, 20-25._

1 Thus says the LORD to his anointed, [.linebr]#/# +
to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held [.linebr]#/# +
to subdue nations before him, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will ungird the loins of kings, [.linebr]#/# +
to open before him the two-leaved gates, [.linebr]#/# +
and the gates shall not be shut:

2 "I will go before you [.linebr]#/# +
and make the crooked places straight. [.linebr]#/# +
I will break in pieces the gates of brass [.linebr]#/# +
and cut apart the bars of iron.

3 And I will give you the treasures of darkness [.linebr]#/# +
and hidden riches of secret places [.linebr]#/# +
so that you may know that I, the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
who call you by your name, am the God of Israel.

4 For Jacob my servant's sake [.linebr]#/# +
and Israel my elect, [.linebr]#/# +
I have even called you by your name. [.linebr]#/# +
I have surnamed you, though you have not known me.

5 I am the LORD, and there is no one else. [.linebr]#/# +
There is no God besides me. [.linebr]#/# +
I girded you, though you have not known me,

6 So that they may know [.linebr]#/# +
from the rising of the sun and from the west, [.linebr]#/# +
that there is no one besides me. [.linebr]#/# +
I am the LORD, and there is no one else.

7 I form the light and create darkness. [.linebr]#/# +
I make peace and create evil. [.linebr]#/# +
I, the LORD, do all these things.

8 Drop down, you heavens, from above, [.linebr]#/# +
and let the skies pour down righteousness. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the earth open, [.linebr]#/# +
and let them bring forth salvation, [.linebr]#/# +
and let righteousness spring up together. [.linebr]#/# +
I, the LORD, have created it.

9 Woe to him who contends with his Maker! [.linebr]#/# +
Let the potsherd contend with the potsherds of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
Shall the clay say to him who fashions it, [.linebr]#/# +
'What are you making?' [.linebr]#/# +
Or shall your work say, [.linebr]#/# +
'He has no hands'?

10 Woe to him who says to his father, [.linebr]#/# +
'What are you begetting?' [.linebr]#/# +
or to the woman, [.linebr]#/# +
'What have you brought forth?'"

11 Thus says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: [.linebr]#/# +
"You ask me about things to come concerning my sons, [.linebr]#/# +
and you command me concerning the work of my hands.

12 I have made the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and created man upon it. [.linebr]#/# +
I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, [.linebr]#/# +
and all their host I have commanded.

13 I have raised him up in righteousness [.linebr]#/# +
and I will direct all his ways. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall build my city [.linebr]#/# +
and let my captives go, [.linebr]#/# +
not for price nor reward," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD of hosts.

14 Thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"The labor of Egypt and merchandise of Cush, [.linebr]#/# +
along with the Sabeans, men of stature, [.linebr]#/# +
shall come over to you, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall be yours. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall come after you. [.linebr]#/# +
In chains they shall come over, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall fall down to you. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall make supplication to you, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
'Surely God is in you, and there is no one else. [.linebr]#/# +
There is no other God.'"

15 Truly you are a God who hides yourself, [.linebr]#/# +
O God of Israel, the Savior.

16 They shall be ashamed and also confounded, all of them. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall go in disgrace together who are makers of idols.

17 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
with an everlasting salvation. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall not be ashamed nor confounded [.linebr]#/# +
to a world without end.

18 For thus says the LORD who created the heavens [.linebr]#/# +
(God himself [.linebr]#/# +
who formed the earth and made it, [.linebr]#/# +
who has established it, [.linebr]#/# +
who did not create it in vain, [.linebr]#/# +
who formed it to be inhabited): [.linebr]#/# +
"I am the LORD, and there is no one else.

19 I have not spoken in secret, [.linebr]#/# +
in a dark place of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
I have not said to the offspring of Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
'Seek me in vain.' [.linebr]#/# +
I, the LORD, speak righteousness. [.linebr]#/# +
I declare things that are right.

20 Assemble yourselves and come. [.linebr]#/# +
Draw near together, [.linebr]#/# +
you who have escaped of the nations. [.linebr]#/# +
They have no knowledge [.linebr]#/# +
who set up the wood of their engraved image [.linebr]#/# +
and pray to a god that cannot save.

21 Announce, and bring them near, [.linebr]#/# +
even let them take counsel together. [.linebr]#/# +
Who has declared this from ancient time? [.linebr]#/# +
Who has told it from that time? [.linebr]#/# +
Have I, the LORD, not? [.linebr]#/# +
And there is no other God besides me, [.linebr]#/# +
a just God and a Savior. [.linebr]#/# +
There is no one besides me.

22 Look to me and be saved, [.linebr]#/# +
all the ends of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
for I am God, and there is no one else.

[[isa045-023]]23 I have sworn by myself, [.linebr]#/# +
the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness [.linebr]#/# +
and shall not return, [.linebr]#/# +
that to me every knee shall bow, [.linebr]#/# +
every tongue shall swear.

24 Surely, one shall say, [.linebr]#/# +
'In the LORD I have righteousness and strength.' [.linebr]#/# +
Even to him men shall come. [.linebr]#/# +
And all who are incensed against him shall be ashamed.

25 In the LORD all the offspring of Israel [.linebr]#/# +
shall be justified and shall glory."

_The idols of Babylon could not save themselves, 1, 2. God saves his people to the end, 3, 4. Idols are not comparable to God for power, 5-11, or present salvation, 12, 13._

1 Bel bows down and Nebo stoops. [.linebr]#/# +
Their idols were upon the beasts and upon the livestock. [.linebr]#/# +
Your loads were heavy. [.linebr]#/# +
They were a burden to the weary beast.

2 They stoop. They bow down together. [.linebr]#/# +
They could not deliver the burden, [.linebr]#/# +
but they themselves have gone into captivity.

3 "Listen to me, O house of Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the remnant of the house of Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
which are borne by me from the birth, [.linebr]#/# +
which are carried from the womb.

4 And even to your old age I am he. [.linebr]#/# +
And even to hoary hairs I will carry you. [.linebr]#/# +
I have made and I will bear. [.linebr]#/# +
I will even carry and will deliver you.

5 To whom will you compare me and make me equal, [.linebr]#/# +
and compare me so that we may be alike?

6 They lavish gold out of the bag [.linebr]#/# +
and weigh silver in the balance. [.linebr]#/# +
They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god. [.linebr]#/# +
They fall down and they even worship.

7 They bear him upon the shoulder. [.linebr]#/# +
They carry him and set him in his place and he stands. [.linebr]#/# +
From his place he shall not move. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, one shall cry to him, yet he cannot answer [.linebr]#/# +
nor save him out of his trouble.

8 Remember this, and show yourselves men. [.linebr]#/# +
Bring it back to mind, O transgressors.

9 Remember the former things of old, [.linebr]#/# +
for I am God, and there is no one else. [.linebr]#/# +
I am God, and there is no one like me,

10 Declaring the end from the beginning, [.linebr]#/# +
and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, [.linebr]#/# +
saying, 'My counsel shall stand, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will do all my pleasure;'

11 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, [.linebr]#/# +
the man who executes my counsel from a far country. [.linebr]#/# +
I have spoken it and I will also bring it to pass. [.linebr]#/# +
I have purposed it and I will also perform it.

12 Listen to me, you stout-hearted, [.linebr]#/# +
who are far from righteousness.

13 I bring my righteousness near. [.linebr]#/# +
It shall not be far off, [.linebr]#/# +

_God's judgment upon Babylon and Chaldea for their unmercifulness, 1-6. Their pride and other sins, 7-10. Their enchantments shall not deliver them, 11-15._

1 "Come down and sit in the dust, [.linebr]#/# +
O virgin daughter of Babylon. [.linebr]#/# +
Sit on the ground without a throne, [.linebr]#/# +
O daughter of the Chaldeans. [.linebr]#/# +
For you shall no longer be called [.linebr]#/# +
tender and delicate.

2 Take the millstones and grind meal. [.linebr]#/# +
Remove your veil. [.linebr]#/# +
Make the leg bare. Uncover the thigh. [.linebr]#/# +
Pass over the rivers.

3 Your nakedness shall be uncovered. [.linebr]#/# +
Even your shame shall be seen. [.linebr]#/# +
I will take vengeance, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will spare no man."

4 As for our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, [.linebr]#/# +
the Holy One of Israel.

5 "Sit silent and go into darkness, [.linebr]#/# +
O daughter of the Chaldeans, [.linebr]#/# +
for you shall no longer be called, [.linebr]#/# +
The Mistress of Kingdoms.

6 I was angry with my people. [.linebr]#/# +
I have polluted my inheritance [.linebr]#/# +
and given them into your hand. [.linebr]#/# +
You showed them no mercy. [.linebr]#/# +
Upon the ancient [.linebr]#/# +
you have very heavily laid your yoke.

[[isa047-007]]7 And you said, [.linebr]#/# +
'I shall be a mistress forever,' [.linebr]#/# +
so that you did not lay these things to your heart, [.linebr]#/# +
neither remembered its latter end.

[[isa047-008]]8 Now therefore, hear this, you who are given to pleasures, [.linebr]#/# +
who dwell carelessly, [.linebr]#/# +
who say in your heart, [.linebr]#/# +
'I am, and no one else besides me. [.linebr]#/# +
I shall not sit as a widow, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall I know the loss of children.'

9 But these two things shall come to you [.linebr]#/# +
in a moment in one day: [.linebr]#/# +
the loss of children and widowhood. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall come upon you in their perfection [.linebr]#/# +
in spite of the multitude of your sorceries [.linebr]#/# +
and in spite of the great abundance of your enchantments.

10 For you have trusted in your wickedness. [.linebr]#/# +
You have said, 'No one sees me.' [.linebr]#/# +
Your wisdom and your knowledge, [.linebr]#/# +
it has perverted you. [.linebr]#/# +
And you have said in your heart, [.linebr]#/# +
'I am, and no one else besides me.'

11 Therefore, evil shall come upon you. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall not know from where it rises. [.linebr]#/# +
And mischief shall fall upon you. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall not be able to put it off. [.linebr]#/# +
And desolation shall come upon you suddenly, [.linebr]#/# +
which you shall not know.

12 Stand now with your enchantments [.linebr]#/# +
and with the multitude of your sorceries [.linebr]#/# +
in which you have labored from your youth. [.linebr]#/# +
It may be you are able to profit. [.linebr]#/# +
Perhaps you may prevail.

13 You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels. [.linebr]#/# +
Now let the astrologers, the star-gazers, [.linebr]#/# +
and the monthly prognosticators [.linebr]#/# +
stand up and save you [.linebr]#/# +
from these things that shall come upon you.

14 Behold, they shall be like stubble. [.linebr]#/# +
The fire shall burn them. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall not deliver themselves [.linebr]#/# +
from the power of the flame. [.linebr]#/# +
There shall not be a coal to warm them [.linebr]#/# +
or a fire to sit by.

15 Thus they shall be to you [.linebr]#/# +
with whom you have labored, [.linebr]#/# +
even your merchants, from your youth. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall each wander to his quarter. [.linebr]#/# +
No one shall save you."

_God, to convince the people of their foreknown obstinacy, revealed his prophecies, 1-8. He saves them for his own sake, 9-11. He exhorts them to obedience because of his power and providence, 12-15. He laments their backwardness, 16-19. He powerfully delivers his people out of Babylon, 20-22._

1 "Hear this, O house of Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
who are called by the name of Israel [.linebr]#/# +
and have come forth out of the waters of Judah, [.linebr]#/# +
who swear by the name of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and make mention of the God of Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
but not in truth nor in righteousness.

2 For they call themselves of the holy city, [.linebr]#/# +
and stay themselves upon the God of Israel. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD of hosts is his name.

3 I have declared the former things from the beginning, [.linebr]#/# +
and they went forth from my mouth [.linebr]#/# +
and I proclaimed them. [.linebr]#/# +
I did them suddenly [.linebr]#/# +
and they came to pass.

4 Because I knew that you are obstinate, [.linebr]#/# +
and your neck is an iron sinew and your brow brass,

5 I have even from the beginning declared it to you. [.linebr]#/# +
Before it came to pass I showed it to you, [.linebr]#/# +
lest you should say, 'My idol has done them, [.linebr]#/# +
and my engraved image and my molten image [.linebr]#/# +
has commanded them.'

6 You have heard it. See all of this. [.linebr]#/# +
And will you not declare it? [.linebr]#/# +
I have showed you new things from this time, [.linebr]#/# +
even hidden things, and you did not know them.

7 They are created now, and not from the beginning, [.linebr]#/# +
even before the day when you did not hear them, [.linebr]#/# +
lest you should say, 'Behold, I knew them.'

8 Indeed, you did not hear. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, you did not know. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, from that time your ear was not opened. [.linebr]#/# +
For I knew that you would deal very treacherously [.linebr]#/# +
and were called a transgressor from the womb.

9 For my name's sake I will defer my anger, [.linebr]#/# +
and for my praise I will refrain for you, [.linebr]#/# +
so that I do not cut you off.

10 Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver. [.linebr]#/# +
I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.

11 For my own sake, even for my own sake, I will do it. [.linebr]#/# +
For how should my name be profaned? [.linebr]#/# +
And I will not give my glory to another.

12 Listen to me, O Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
and Israel my called. [.linebr]#/# +
I am he. I am the first. [.linebr]#/# +
I am also the last.

13 My hand has also laid the foundation of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and my right hand has spanned the heavens. [.linebr]#/# +
When I call to them, [.linebr]#/# +
they stand up together.

14 All of you, assemble yourselves and hear. [.linebr]#/# +
Who among them has declared these things? [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD has loved him. [.linebr]#/# +
He will do his pleasure on Babylon, [.linebr]#/# +
and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.

15 I, even I, have spoken. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, I have called him. [.linebr]#/# +
I have brought him, [.linebr]#/# +
and he shall make his way prosperous.

16 Come near to me. Hear this. [.linebr]#/# +
I have not spoken in secret from the beginning. [.linebr]#/# +
From the time that it was, there I am. [.linebr]#/# +
And now the Lord GOD and his Spirit has sent me."

17 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, [.linebr]#/# +
the Holy One of Israel: [.linebr]#/# +
"I am the LORD your God, [.linebr]#/# +
who teaches you to profit, [.linebr]#/# +
who leads you by the way that you should go.

18 O that you had listened to my commandments! [.linebr]#/# +
Then your peace would have been like a river [.linebr]#/# +
and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.

19 Your descendants also would have been like the sand, [.linebr]#/# +
and the offspring of your body like its grains. [.linebr]#/# +
His name should not have been cut off [.linebr]#/# +
nor destroyed from before me."

20 Go forth from Babylon. [.linebr]#/# +
Flee from the Chaldeans. [.linebr]#/# +
With a voice of singing [.linebr]#/# +
declare, tell this, [.linebr]#/# +
and utter it even to the end of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
saying, "The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob."

21 And they did not thirst [.linebr]#/# +
when he led them through the deserts. [.linebr]#/# +
He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them. [.linebr]#/# +

1 Listen to me, O islands, [.linebr]#/# +
and listen, you people, from far. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD has called me from the womb. [.linebr]#/# +
From the body of my mother [.linebr]#/# +
he has made mention of my name.

2 And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword. [.linebr]#/# +
In the shadow of his hand he has hid me. [.linebr]#/# +
He made me a polished shaft, [.linebr]#/# +
and in his quiver he has hid me.

3 And he said to me, "You are my servant, [.linebr]#/# +
O Israel, in whom I will be glorified."

4 Then I said, "I have labored in vain. [.linebr]#/# +
I have spent my strength for nothing and in vain. [.linebr]#/# +
Yet surely my judgment is with the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and my work with my God."

5 And now, the LORD says, [.linebr]#/# +
who formed me from the womb to be his servant [.linebr]#/# +
to bring Jacob back to him, [.linebr]#/# +
though Israel is not gathered [.linebr]#/# +
(yet I shall be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and my God shall be my strength),

that you should be my servant [.linebr]#/# +
to raise up the tribes of Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
and to restore the preserved of Israel. [.linebr]#/# +
I will also give you as a light to the Gentiles [.linebr]#/# +
so that you may be my salvation [.linebr]#/# +

7 Thus says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, [.linebr]#/# +
to him whom man despises, [.linebr]#/# +
to him whom the nation abhors, [.linebr]#/# +

"Kings shall see and arise, [.linebr]#/# +
princes also shall worship, [.linebr]#/# +
because of the LORD who is faithful, [.linebr]#/# +
and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you."

[[isa049-008]]8 Thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"In an acceptable time I have heard you, [.linebr]#/# +
and in a day of salvation I have helped you. [.linebr]#/# +
And I will preserve you and give you [.linebr]#/# +
as a covenant to the people, [.linebr]#/# +
to establish the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
to cause to inherit the desolate heritages,

9 So that you may say to the prisoners, 'Go forth,' [.linebr]#/# +
to those who are in darkness, 'Show yourselves.' [.linebr]#/# +
They shall feed in the ways, [.linebr]#/# +
and their pastures shall be in all high places.

[[isa049-010]]10 They shall neither hunger nor thirst, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall the heat or sun smite them, [.linebr]#/# +
for he who has mercy on them shall lead them, [.linebr]#/# +
even by the springs of water he shall guide them.

11 And I will make all my mountains a way, [.linebr]#/# +
and my highways shall be exalted.

12 Behold, these shall come from far. [.linebr]#/# +
And behold, these from the north and from the west, [.linebr]#/# +

13 Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and break forth into singing, O mountains, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD has comforted his people [.linebr]#/# +
and will have mercy upon his afflicted.

14 But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me, [.linebr]#/# +

15 "Can a woman forget her nursing child, [.linebr]#/# +
that she should not have compassion [.linebr]#/# +

16 Behold, I have engraved you [.linebr]#/# +

Your walls are continually before me.

17 Your children shall make haste. [.linebr]#/# +
Your destroyers and those who made you waste [.linebr]#/# +
shall go forth from you.

18 Lift up your eyes around and behold. [.linebr]#/# +
All these assemble themselves and come to you. [.linebr]#/# +
As I live," says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"you shall surely clothe yourself with them all [.linebr]#/# +

19 For your waste and your desolate places [.linebr]#/# +
and the land of your destruction [.linebr]#/# +

And those who swallowed you up [.linebr]#/# +

20 The children which you shall have, [.linebr]#/# +
after you have lost the other, [.linebr]#/# +
shall say again in your ears, [.linebr]#/# +
'The place is too narrow for me. [.linebr]#/# +
Give place to me so that I may dwell.'

21 Then you shall say in your heart, [.linebr]#/# +
'Who has begotten these for me, [.linebr]#/# +
seeing I have lost my children and am desolate, [.linebr]#/# +
a captive, and wandering to and fro? [.linebr]#/# +
And who has brought these up? [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, I was left alone. [.linebr]#/# +
These, where have they been?'"

22 Thus says the Lord GOD: [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles [.linebr]#/# +
and set up my standard to the people. [.linebr]#/# +
And they shall bring your sons in their arms, [.linebr]#/# +
and your daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.

23 And kings shall be your nursing fathers, [.linebr]#/# +
and their queens your nursing mothers. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall bow to you with their face toward the earth [.linebr]#/# +
and lick up the dust of your feet. [.linebr]#/# +
And you shall know that I am the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
for they shall not be ashamed who wait for me.

24 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, [.linebr]#/# +
or the lawful captive delivered?"

25 But thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, [.linebr]#/# +
and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered, [.linebr]#/# +
for I will contend with him who contends with you, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will save your children.

26 And I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall be drunken with their own blood, [.linebr]#/# +
as with sweet wine. [.linebr]#/# +
And all flesh shall know [.linebr]#/# +
that I, the LORD, am your Savior [.linebr]#/# +
and your Redeemer, [.linebr]#/# +
the mighty One of Jacob."

_Christ shows that the dereliction of the Jews is not to be imputed to him, by his ability to save, 1-4; by his obedience in that work, 5, 6; and by his confidence in that assistance, 7-9. An exhortation to trust in God and not in ourselves, 10, 11._

1 Thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, [.linebr]#/# +
whom I have put away? [.linebr]#/# +
Or which of my creditors is it [.linebr]#/# +
to whom I have sold you? [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, for your iniquities you have sold yourselves, [.linebr]#/# +
and for your transgressions your mother is put away.

2 Why, when I came, was there no man? [.linebr]#/# +
Why, when I called, was there no one to answer? [.linebr]#/# +
Is my hand shortened at all so that it cannot redeem? [.linebr]#/# +
Or have I no power to deliver? [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. [.linebr]#/# +
I make the rivers a wilderness. [.linebr]#/# +
Their fish become putrid because there is no water [.linebr]#/# +
and die for thirst.

3 I clothe the heavens with blackness [.linebr]#/# +
and I make sackcloth their covering."

4 The Lord GOD has given me [.linebr]#/# +
the tongue of the learned, [.linebr]#/# +
so that I should know how to speak a word [.linebr]#/# +
in season to him who is weary. [.linebr]#/# +
He wakens morning by morning, [.linebr]#/# +
he wakens my ear [.linebr]#/# +
to hear as the learned.

5 The Lord GOD opened my ear, [.linebr]#/# +
and I was not rebellious, [.linebr]#/# +
neither turned away backward.

6 I gave my back to the smiters [.linebr]#/# +
and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair. [.linebr]#/# +
I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.

7 For the Lord GOD will help me; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, I shall not be confounded. [.linebr]#/# +
Therefore, I have set my face like a flint, [.linebr]#/# +
and I know that I shall not be ashamed.

8 He is near who justifies me. [.linebr]#/# +
Who will contend with me? [.linebr]#/# +
Let us stand together. [.linebr]#/# +
Who is my adversary? [.linebr]#/# +
Let him come near to me.

9 Behold the Lord GOD will help me. [.linebr]#/# +
Who is he who shall condemn me? [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, all of them shall wax old like a garment. [.linebr]#/# +
The moth shall eat them up.

10 Who is among you who fears the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
who obeys the voice of his servant, [.linebr]#/# +
who walks in darkness and has no light? [.linebr]#/# +
Let him trust in the name of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and rely upon his God.

11 Behold, all you who kindle a fire, [.linebr]#/# +
who encompass yourselves with sparks, [.linebr]#/# +
walk in the light of your fire [.linebr]#/# +
and in the sparks that you have kindled. [.linebr]#/# +
This you shall have from my hand: [.linebr]#/# +
you shall lie down in sorrow.

_An exhortation, after the pattern of Abraham, to trust in Christ, 1, 2, by reason of his comfortable promises, 3, of his righteous salvation, 4-6, and man's mortality, 7, 8. Christ by his sanctified arm defends his people from the fear of man, 9-16. He bewails the afflictions of Jerusalem, 17-20, and promises deliverance, 21-23._

1 "Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
you who seek the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Look to the rock from where you are hewn, [.linebr]#/# +
and to the hole of the pit from where you are dug.

2 Look to Abraham your father [.linebr]#/# +
and to Sarah who bore you, [.linebr]#/# +
for I called him alone, [.linebr]#/# +
blessed him, and increased him.

3 For the LORD will comfort Zion. [.linebr]#/# +
He will comfort all her waste places, [.linebr]#/# +
and he will make her wilderness like Eden [.linebr]#/# +
and her desert like the garden of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Joy and gladness shall be found therein, [.linebr]#/# +
thanksgiving and the voice of melody.

4 Listen to me, my people, [.linebr]#/# +
and give ear to me, O my nation. [.linebr]#/# +
For a law shall proceed from me, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will make my judgment to rest [.linebr]#/# +
as a light to the people.

5 My righteousness is near. [.linebr]#/# +
My salvation has gone forth, [.linebr]#/# +
and my arms shall judge the people. [.linebr]#/# +
The coastlands shall wait upon me, [.linebr]#/# +
and in my arm they shall trust.

6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens [.linebr]#/# +
and look upon the earth beneath, [.linebr]#/# +
for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, [.linebr]#/# +
the earth shall become old like a garment, [.linebr]#/# +
and its inhabitants shall die in a like manner. [.linebr]#/# +
But my salvation shall be forever [.linebr]#/# +
and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

7 Listen to me, you who know righteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
the people in whose heart my law is. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not fear the reproach of men, [.linebr]#/# +
neither be afraid of their revilings.

8 For the moth shall eat them like a garment, [.linebr]#/# +
and the worm shall eat them like wool. [.linebr]#/# +
But my righteousness shall be forever, [.linebr]#/# +
and my salvation from generation to generation."

9 Awake, awake, put on your strength, [.linebr]#/# +
O arm of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Awake, as in the ancient days, [.linebr]#/# +
in the generations of old. [.linebr]#/# +
Is it not you who cut Rahab [.linebr]#/# +
and wounded the dragon?

10 Is it not you who dried the sea, [.linebr]#/# +
the waters of the great deep, [.linebr]#/# +
who has made the depths of the sea a way [.linebr]#/# +
for the ransomed to pass over?

11 Therefore, the redeemed of the LORD shall return [.linebr]#/# +
and come with singing to Zion, [.linebr]#/# +
and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall obtain gladness and joy. [.linebr]#/# +
Sorrow and mourning shall flee away.

12 "I, even I, am he who comforts you. [.linebr]#/# +
Who are you, that you should be afraid [.linebr]#/# +
of a man who shall die, [.linebr]#/# +
and of the son of man [.linebr]#/# +
who shall be made as grass,

13 That you forget the LORD your maker, [.linebr]#/# +
who has stretched forth the heavens [.linebr]#/# +
and laid the foundations of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and that you have feared continually every day [.linebr]#/# +
because of the fury of the oppressor, [.linebr]#/# +
as if he were ready to destroy? [.linebr]#/# +
And where is the fury of the oppressor?

14 The captive exile hastens so that he may be released. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall not die in the pit, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall his bread fail.

15 But I am the LORD your God [.linebr]#/# +
who divided the sea, whose waves roared. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD of hosts is his name.

16 And I have put my words in your mouth [.linebr]#/# +
and have covered you in the shadow of my hand, [.linebr]#/# +
so that I may plant the heavens, [.linebr]#/# +
lay the foundations of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and say to Zion, 'You are my people.'"

17 Awake, awake, [.linebr]#/# +
stand up, O Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
which have drank from the hand of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
the cup of his fury. [.linebr]#/# +
You have drank the dregs of the cup of trembling [.linebr]#/# +
and wrung them out.

18 There is no one to guide her [.linebr]#/# +
among all the sons whom she has brought forth, [.linebr]#/# +
neither is there any who takes her by the hand [.linebr]#/# +
of all the sons whom she has brought up.

19 There are two things that have come to you [.linebr]#/# +
(who shall be sorry for you?): [.linebr]#/# +
they are desolation and destruction, [.linebr]#/# +
famine and the sword. [.linebr]#/# +
By whom shall I comfort you?

20 Your sons have fainted. [.linebr]#/# +
They lie at the head of all the streets [.linebr]#/# +
like a gazelle in a net. [.linebr]#/# +
They are full of the fury of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
the rebuke of your God.

21 Now therefore, hear this, you afflicted [.linebr]#/# +
and drunken, but not with wine.

22 Thus says your Lord Yahweh, [.linebr]#/# +
and your God who pleads the cause of his people: [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold, I have taken out of your hand [.linebr]#/# +
the cup of trembling, [.linebr]#/# +
even the dregs of the cup of my fury. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall no longer drink it again.

23 But I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, [.linebr]#/# +
who have said to your soul, [.linebr]#/# +
'Prostrate yourself so that we may go over.' [.linebr]#/# +
And you have laid your body like the ground, [.linebr]#/# +

_The prophet, lamenting incredulity, excuses the scandal of the cross, 1-3, by the benefit of his passion, 4-9, and the good success thereof, 10-12._

[[isa053-001]]1 Who has believed our report? [.linebr]#/# +
And to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?

2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant [.linebr]#/# +
and as a root out of a dry ground. [.linebr]#/# +
He has no form nor majesty. And when we see him, [.linebr]#/# +
there is no beauty that we should desire him.

3 He is despised and rejected by men, [.linebr]#/# +
a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. [.linebr]#/# +
And like one from whom we hide our faces, [.linebr]#/# +
he was despised, and we did not esteem him.

[[isa053-004]]4 Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, [.linebr]#/# +
yet we esteemed him stricken, [.linebr]#/# +
smitten by God, and afflicted.

[[isa053-005]]5 But he was wounded for our transgressions. [.linebr]#/# +
He was bruised for our iniquities. [.linebr]#/# +
The chastisement of our peace was upon him, [.linebr]#/# +
and with his stripes we are healed.

6 We have all like sheep gone astray. [.linebr]#/# +
We have each turned to his own way, [.linebr]#/# +
and the LORD has laid on him [.linebr]#/# +
the iniquity of us all.

[[isa053-007]]7 He was oppressed and he was afflicted, [.linebr]#/# +
yet he did not open his mouth. [.linebr]#/# +
He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, [.linebr]#/# +
and as a sheep before her shearers is mute, [.linebr]#/# +
so he did not open his mouth.

[[isa053-008]]8 He was taken from prison and from judgment. [.linebr]#/# +
And who shall declare his generation? [.linebr]#/# +
For he was cut off from the land of the living. [.linebr]#/# +
For the transgression of my people he was stricken.

[[isa053-009]]9 And he made his grave with the wicked, [.linebr]#/# +
and with the rich in his death, [.linebr]#/# +
because he had done no violence, [.linebr]#/# +
neither was any deceit in his mouth.

10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him. [.linebr]#/# +
He has put him to grief. [.linebr]#/# +
When you make his soul an offering for sin, [.linebr]#/# +
he shall see his offspring. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall prolong his days, [.linebr]#/# +
and the pleasure of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
shall prosper in his hand.

11 He shall see of the travail of his soul [.linebr]#/# +
and shall be satisfied. [.linebr]#/# +
By his knowledge [.linebr]#/# +
my righteous servant shall justify many, [.linebr]#/# +
for he shall bear their iniquities.

[[isa053-012]]12 Therefore, I will divide to him a portion with the great, [.linebr]#/# +
and he shall divide the plunder with the strong, [.linebr]#/# +
because he has poured out his soul to death [.linebr]#/# +
and he was numbered with the transgressors. [.linebr]#/# +
And he bore the sin of many [.linebr]#/# +
and made intercession for the transgressors.

I hid my face from you for a moment, [.linebr]#/# +

I will have mercy on you," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD your Redeemer.

9 "For this is like the waters of Noah to me. [.linebr]#/# +
For as I have sworn that the waters of Noah [.linebr]#/# +
shall no longer overflow the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, [.linebr]#/# +

and the hills be removed, [.linebr]#/# +
but my kindness shall not depart from you, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD who has mercy on you.

11 "Oh you afflicted, tossed with tempest [.linebr]#/# +
and not comforted, [.linebr]#/# +
behold, I will lay your stones with fair colors [.linebr]#/# +
and lay your foundations with sapphires.

12 And I will make your windows of agates, [.linebr]#/# +
your gates of carbuncles, [.linebr]#/# +
and all your borders of pleasant stones.

[[isa054-013]]13 And all your children shall be taught from the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and the peace of your children shall be great.

14 In righteousness you shall be established. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall be far from oppression, [.linebr]#/# +
for you shall not fear. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall be far from terror, [.linebr]#/# +
for it shall not come near you.

15 Behold, they shall surely assemble, but not by me. [.linebr]#/# +
Whoever assembles against you shall fall for your sake.

16 Behold, I have created the smith [.linebr]#/# +
who blows the coals in the fire [.linebr]#/# +

And I have created the waster to destroy.

17 No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper. [.linebr]#/# +
And every tongue that rises against you in judgment [.linebr]#/# +

This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +

2 Blessed is the man who does this, [.linebr]#/# +
and the son of man who lays hold upon it, [.linebr]#/# +
who keeps the sabbath from profaning it, [.linebr]#/# +
and keeps his hand from doing any evil."

3 Do not let the son of the stranger, [.linebr]#/# +
who has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
"The LORD has utterly separated me from his people," [.linebr]#/# +
neither let the eunuch say, [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold, I am a dry tree."

4 For thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"To the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths [.linebr]#/# +
and choose the things that please me [.linebr]#/# +
and take hold of my covenant,

5 Even to them I will give in my house [.linebr]#/# +
and within my walls a place and a name [.linebr]#/# +
better than that of sons and daughters. [.linebr]#/# +
I will give them an everlasting name [.linebr]#/# +
that shall not be cut off.

6 Also, the sons of the stranger [.linebr]#/# +
who join themselves to the LORD to serve him, [.linebr]#/# +
to love the name of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and to be his servants, [.linebr]#/# +
everyone who keeps the sabbath from profaning it [.linebr]#/# +
and takes hold of my covenant,

[[isa056-007]]7 Even them I will bring to my holy mountain [.linebr]#/# +
and make them joyful in my house of prayer. [.linebr]#/# +
Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices [.linebr]#/# +
shall be accepted upon my altar, [.linebr]#/# +
for my house shall be called [.linebr]#/# +
a house of prayer for all people."

8 The Lord GOD who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, [.linebr]#/# +
"Yet I will gather others to him, [.linebr]#/# +
besides those who are gathered to him."

9 All you beasts of the field, come to devour, [.linebr]#/# +
even all you beasts in the forest.

10 His watchmen are blind. [.linebr]#/# +
They are all ignorant. [.linebr]#/# +
They are all mute dogs [.linebr]#/# +
that cannot bark. [.linebr]#/# +
They are sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.

11 Indeed, they are greedy dogs [.linebr]#/# +
which can never have enough, [.linebr]#/# +
and they are shepherds [.linebr]#/# +
who cannot understand. [.linebr]#/# +
They all look to their own way, [.linebr]#/# +
each for his gain, from his quarter.

12 "Come," they say, "I will bring wine, [.linebr]#/# +
and we will fill ourselves with strong drink, [.linebr]#/# +
and tomorrow shall be like this day, [.linebr]#/# +
and much more abundant."

_The blessed death of the righteous, 1, 2. God reproves the Jews for their lewd idolatry, 3-12. He gives promises of mercy to the penitent, 13-21._

1 The righteous perish, [.linebr]#/# +
and no man lays it to heart. [.linebr]#/# +
And merciful men are taken away, [.linebr]#/# +
no one considering [.linebr]#/# +
that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.

2 He shall enter into peace. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall rest in their beds, [.linebr]#/# +
each one walking in his uprightness.

3 "But draw near here, [.linebr]#/# +
you sons of the sorceress, [.linebr]#/# +
the offspring of the adulterer and the lewd.

4 Who are you mocking? [.linebr]#/# +
Against whom do you make a wide mouth [.linebr]#/# +
and thrust out the tongue? [.linebr]#/# +
Are you not children of transgression, [.linebr]#/# +
offspring of falsehood,

5 Inflaming yourselves with idols [.linebr]#/# +
under every green tree, [.linebr]#/# +
slaying the children in the valleys [.linebr]#/# +
under the cliffs of the rocks?

6 Among the smooth stones of the stream is your portion. [.linebr]#/# +
They, they are your lot. [.linebr]#/# +
Even to them you have poured a drink-offering. [.linebr]#/# +
You have offered a food-offering. [.linebr]#/# +
Should I receive comfort in these?

7 Upon a lofty and high mountain [.linebr]#/# +
you have set your bed. [.linebr]#/# +
Even there you went up [.linebr]#/# +
to offer sacrifice.

8 Behind the doors and also the posts [.linebr]#/# +
you have set up your remembrance, [.linebr]#/# +
for you have uncovered yourself [.linebr]#/# +
to someone other than me [.linebr]#/# +
and have gone up. [.linebr]#/# +
You have enlarged your bed [.linebr]#/# +
and made yourself a covenant with them. [.linebr]#/# +
You loved their bed [.linebr]#/# +
where you saw it.

9 And you went to the king with ointment [.linebr]#/# +
and increased your perfumes. [.linebr]#/# +
You sent your messengers far off, [.linebr]#/# +
and debased yourself even to hell.

10 You are wearied in the greatness of your way, [.linebr]#/# +
yet you did not say, 'There is no hope.' [.linebr]#/# +
You have found the life of your hand; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, you were not grieved.

11 And of whom have you been afraid or feared, [.linebr]#/# +
so that you have lied and not remembered me [.linebr]#/# +
nor laid it to your heart? [.linebr]#/# +
Have I not held my peace even of old, [.linebr]#/# +
and you do not fear me?

12 I will declare your righteousness and your works, [.linebr]#/# +
for they shall not profit you.

13 When you cry, let your companies deliver you. [.linebr]#/# +
But the wind shall carry them all away. [.linebr]#/# +
Vanity shall take them. [.linebr]#/# +
But he who puts his trust in me shall possess the land [.linebr]#/# +
and shall inherit my holy mountain."

14 He shall say, [.linebr]#/# +
"Cast up, cast up, prepare the way, [.linebr]#/# +
take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people."

15 For thus says the high and lofty One [.linebr]#/# +
who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: [.linebr]#/# +
"I dwell in the high and holy place, [.linebr]#/# +
with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit, [.linebr]#/# +
to revive the spirit of the humble [.linebr]#/# +
and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.

16 For I will not contend forever, [.linebr]#/# +
neither will I always be angry, [.linebr]#/# +
for the spirit would fail before me— [.linebr]#/# +
the souls which I have made.

17 For the iniquity of his covetousness [.linebr]#/# +
I was angry and smote him. [.linebr]#/# +
I hid myself and was angry, [.linebr]#/# +
and he went on backsliding [.linebr]#/# +
in the way of his heart.

18 I have seen his ways and will heal him. [.linebr]#/# +
I will also lead him [.linebr]#/# +
and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.

[[isa057-019]]19 I create the fruit of the lips. [.linebr]#/# +
Peace, peace to him who is far off [.linebr]#/# +
and to him who is near," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"and I will heal him."

20 But the wicked are like the troubled sea [.linebr]#/# +
when it cannot rest, [.linebr]#/# +
whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

21 "There is no peace," [.linebr]#/# +
says my God, "for the wicked."

_The prophet, being sent to reprove hypocrisy, shows the difference between a counterfeit fast and a true fast, 1-7. He declares what promises are due to godliness, 8-12, and to the keeping of the sabbath, 13, 14._

1 "Cry aloud, do not spare. [.linebr]#/# +
Lift up your voice like a trumpet. [.linebr]#/# +
Show my people their transgression, [.linebr]#/# +
and the house of Jacob their sins.

2 Yet they seek me daily [.linebr]#/# +
and delight to know my ways, [.linebr]#/# +
like a nation that did righteousness [.linebr]#/# +
and did not forsake the ordinance of their God. [.linebr]#/# +
They ask of me the ordinances of justice. [.linebr]#/# +
They take delight in approaching to God.

3 'Why have we fasted, they say, and you do not see? [.linebr]#/# +
Why have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge?' [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure [.linebr]#/# +
and exact all your labors.

4 Behold, you fast for strife and debate [.linebr]#/# +
and to smite with the fist of wickedness. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall not fast as you do this day [.linebr]#/# +
to make your voice to be heard on high.

5 Is this the fast that I have chosen: [.linebr]#/# +
a day for a man to afflict his soul? [.linebr]#/# +
Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush [.linebr]#/# +
and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? [.linebr]#/# +
Will you call this a fast [.linebr]#/# +
and an acceptable day to the LORD?

6 Is this not the fast that I have chosen: [.linebr]#/# +
to release the bonds of wickedness, [.linebr]#/# +
to undo the heavy burdens, [.linebr]#/# +
and to let the oppressed go free, [.linebr]#/# +
and that you break every yoke?

7 Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry, [.linebr]#/# +
and that you should bring the poor who are cast out to your house, [.linebr]#/# +
when you see the naked that you should cover him, [.linebr]#/# +
and that you should not hide yourself from your own flesh?

8 Then your light shall break forth like the morning, [.linebr]#/# +
and your health shall spring forth speedily. [.linebr]#/# +
And your righteousness shall go before you. [.linebr]#/# +
The glory of the LORD shall be your rear-ward.

9 Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall cry, and he will say, 'Here I am.' [.linebr]#/# +
If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, [.linebr]#/# +
the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity,

10 And if you draw out your soul to the hungry [.linebr]#/# +
and satisfy the afflicted soul, [.linebr]#/# +
then your light shall rise in obscurity [.linebr]#/# +
and your darkness shall be like the noon day.

11 And the LORD will guide you continually, [.linebr]#/# +
satisfy your soul in drought, [.linebr]#/# +
and make your bones fat. [.linebr]#/# +
And you shall be like a watered garden [.linebr]#/# +
and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.

12 And those amidst you shall build the old waste places. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall raise up the foundations of many generations, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall be called, The Repairer of the Breach, [.linebr]#/# +
The Restorer of Paths to Dwell In.

13 If you turn away your foot from the sabbath, [.linebr]#/# +
from doing your pleasure on my holy day, [.linebr]#/# +
and call the sabbath a delight, [.linebr]#/# +
and the holy [day] of the LORD honorable, [.linebr]#/# +
and honor him, not doing your own ways, [.linebr]#/# +
nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words,

14 Then you shall delight yourself in the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will cause you to ride upon the high places of the earth [.linebr]#/# +
and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father. [.linebr]#/# +
For the mouth of the LORD has spoken it."

|
|1 Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened [.linebr]#/# +
so that it cannot save, [.linebr]#/# +
neither his ear heavy [.linebr]#/# +
so that it cannot hear.

|
|2 But your iniquities have come between [.linebr]#/# +
and separated you and your God, [.linebr]#/# +
and your sins have hid his face from you [.linebr]#/# +
so that he will not hear.

|
|3 For your hands are defiled with blood [.linebr]#/# +
and your fingers with iniquity. [.linebr]#/# +
Your lips have spoken lies, [.linebr]#/# +
your tongue has uttered perverseness.

|
|4 No one calls for justice, [.linebr]#/# +
nor any pleads for truth. [.linebr]#/# +
They trust in vanity and speak lies. [.linebr]#/# +
They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.

|
|5 They hatch adders' eggs [.linebr]#/# +
and weave the spider's web. [.linebr]#/# +
He who eats their eggs dies, [.linebr]#/# +
and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.

|
|6 Their webs shall not become garments, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall they cover themselves with their works. [.linebr]#/# +
Their works are works of iniquity, [.linebr]#/# +
and the act of violence is in their hands.

|
|[[isa059-007]]7 Their feet run to evil, [.linebr]#/# +
and they make haste to shed innocent blood. [.linebr]#/# +
Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity. [.linebr]#/# +
Wasting and destruction are in their paths.

|
|[[isa059-008]]8 The way of peace they do not know, [.linebr]#/# +
and there is no judgment in their goings. [.linebr]#/# +
They have made themselves crooked paths. [.linebr]#/# +
Whoever goes therein shall not know peace.

|
|9 Therefore, judgment is far from us, [.linebr]#/# +
neither does justice overtake us. [.linebr]#/# +
We wait for light, but behold obscurity, [.linebr]#/# +
for brightness, but we walk in darkness.

|
|10 We grope for the wall like the blind, [.linebr]#/# +
and we grope as if we had no eyes. [.linebr]#/# +
We stumble at noon day as in the night. [.linebr]#/# +
We are in desolate places as dead men.

|
|11 We all roar like bears [.linebr]#/# +
and mourn bitterly like doves. [.linebr]#/# +
We look for judgment, but there is none, [.linebr]#/# +
for salvation, but it is far from us.

|
|12 For our transgressions are multiplied before you [.linebr]#/# +
and our sins testify against us, [.linebr]#/# +
for our transgressions are with us, [.linebr]#/# +
and as for our iniquities, we know them,

|
|13 In transgressing and lying against the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and departing away from our God, [.linebr]#/# +
speaking oppression and revolt, [.linebr]#/# +
conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

|
|14 And judgment is turned away backward, [.linebr]#/# +
and justice stands afar off. [.linebr]#/# +
For truth has fallen in the street, [.linebr]#/# +
and equity cannot enter.

|
|15 Indeed, truth fails. [.linebr]#/# +
And he who departs from evil makes himself plunder. [.linebr]#/# +
And the LORD saw it, and it displeased him [.linebr]#/# +
that there was no judgment.

|
|16 And he saw that there was no man, [.linebr]#/# +
and wondered that there was no intercessor; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, his arm brought salvation to him, [.linebr]#/# +
and his righteousness, it sustained him.

|
|[[isa059-017]]17 For he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, [.linebr]#/# +
and a helmet of salvation upon his head. [.linebr]#/# +
And he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, [.linebr]#/# +
and was clad with zeal as a cloak.

|
|18 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay: [.linebr]#/# +
fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies. [.linebr]#/# +
To the coastlands he will repay recompense.

|
|19 So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west, [.linebr]#/# +
and his glory from the rising of the sun. [.linebr]#/# +
When the enemy comes in like a flood, [.linebr]#/# +
the Spirit of the LORD will lift up a standard against him.

|
|[[isa059-020]]20 "And the Redeemer will come to Zion [.linebr]#/# +
and to those in Jacob who turn from transgression," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

[[isa059-021]]21 "As for me, this is my covenant with them," says the LORD. "My Spirit who is upon you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your children, nor out of the mouth of your children's children," says the LORD, "from now on and forever."

They shall not be shut, day or night, [.linebr]#/# +

12 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, those nations shall be utterly wasted.

13 The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, [.linebr]#/# +

And I will make the place of my feet glorious.

I will also make your officers peace [.linebr]#/# +

They shall inherit the land forever, [.linebr]#/# +

9 But those who have gathered it shall eat it [.linebr]#/# +
and praise the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who have collected it shall drink it [.linebr]#/# +
in the courts of my holiness."

10 Go through, go through the gates. [.linebr]#/# +
Prepare the way of the people. [.linebr]#/# +
Cast up, cast up the highway. [.linebr]#/# +
Gather out the stones. [.linebr]#/# +
Lift up a standard for the people.

11 Behold, the LORD has proclaimed [.linebr]#/# +
to the end of the world, [.linebr]#/# +
"Say to the daughter of Zion, [.linebr]#/# +
'Behold, your salvation comes. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, his reward is with him [.linebr]#/# +
and his work before him.'"

12 And they shall call them, The Holy People, [.linebr]#/# +
The Redeemed of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
And you shall be called, Sought Out, [.linebr]#/# +
A City not Forsaken.

[.outline.text-center]
_Christ shows who he is, 1, his victory over his enemies, 2-6, and his mercy toward his church, 7-9. In his just wrath he remembers his free mercy, 10-14. The church, in her prayer, 15, 16, makes confession and professes her faith, 17-19._

1 Who is this who comes from Edom [.linebr]#/# +
with dyed garments from Bozrah, [.linebr]#/# +
this who is glorious in his apparel, [.linebr]#/# +
traveling in the greatness of his strength? [.linebr]#/# +
"I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save."

2 Why are you red in your apparel, [.linebr]#/# +
and your garments like him who treads in the wine-vat.

3 "I have trodden the wine-press alone, [.linebr]#/# +
and from the people there was no one with me. [.linebr]#/# +
For I will tread them in my anger [.linebr]#/# +
and trample them in my fury, [.linebr]#/# +
and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will stain all my clothing.

4 For the day of vengeance is in my heart, [.linebr]#/# +
and the year of my redeemed has come.

5 And I looked, and there was no one to help. [.linebr]#/# +
And I wondered that there was no one to uphold. [.linebr]#/# +
Therefore, my own arm brought salvation to me. [.linebr]#/# +
And my fury, it upheld me.

6 And I will tread down the people in my anger [.linebr]#/# +
and make them drunk in my fury, [.linebr]#/# +
and I will bring their strength down to the earth."

7 I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and the praises of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
according to all that the LORD has bestowed on us [.linebr]#/# +
and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies [.linebr]#/# +
and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.

8 For he said, "Surely they are my people, [.linebr]#/# +
children who will not lie." [.linebr]#/# +
So he was their Savior.

9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, [.linebr]#/# +
and the angel of his presence saved them. [.linebr]#/# +
In his love and in his pity he redeemed them. [.linebr]#/# +
And he bore them and carried them all the days of old.

10 But they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, he was turned to be their enemy [.linebr]#/# +
and he fought against them.

11 Then he remembered the days of old, [.linebr]#/# +
Moses and his people, saying, [.linebr]#/# +
"Where is he who brought them out of the sea [.linebr]#/# +
with the shepherd of his flock? [.linebr]#/# +
Where is he who put his Holy Spirit [.linebr]#/# +
within him,

12 Who led them by the right hand of Moses [.linebr]#/# +
with his glorious arm, [.linebr]#/# +
dividing the water before them, [.linebr]#/# +
to make himself an everlasting name,

13 Who led them through the deep, [.linebr]#/# +
like a horse in the wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
so that they should not stumble?"

14 Like the livestock that go down in the valley, [.linebr]#/# +
the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus you led your people [.linebr]#/# +
to make yourself a glorious name.

15 Look down from heaven and behold [.linebr]#/# +
from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory. [.linebr]#/# +
Where is your zeal and your strength, [.linebr]#/# +
the sounding of your heart and of your mercy toward me? [.linebr]#/# +
Are they restrained?

16 Doubtless you are our Father, [.linebr]#/# +
though Abraham is ignorant of us, [.linebr]#/# +
and Israel does not acknowledge us. [.linebr]#/# +
You, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer. [.linebr]#/# +
Your name is from everlasting.

17 O LORD, why have you made us to err from your ways [.linebr]#/# +
and hardened our heart from your fear? [.linebr]#/# +
Return for your servants' sake, [.linebr]#/# +
the tribes of your inheritance.

18 The people of your holiness have possessed it only a little while. [.linebr]#/# +
Our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.

19 We are yours. You never bore rule over them. [.linebr]#/# +
They were not called by your name.

[#isa064%breakable]
=== Chapter 64

[.outline.text-center]
_The church prays for the illustration of God's power, 1-3. Celebrating God's mercy, it makes confession of their natural corruptions, 4-8. The church bemoans their afflictions, 9-12._

1 Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down, [.linebr]#/# +
so that the mountains might flow down at your presence—

2 As when the fire burns brushwood [.linebr]#/# +
and the fire causes the waters to boil— [.linebr]#/# +
to make your name known to your adversaries [.linebr]#/# +
so that the nations may tremble at your presence!

3 When you did awesome things [.linebr]#/# +
which we did not look for, [.linebr]#/# +
you came down, [.linebr]#/# +
the mountains flowed down at your presence.

[[isa064-004]]4 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, [.linebr]#/# +
nor perceived by the ear, [.linebr]#/# +
neither has the eye seen, O God, besides you, [.linebr]#/# +
what he has prepared for him who waits for him.

5 You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
those who remember you in your ways. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, you are angry, for we have sinned. [.linebr]#/# +
We continued in them, and we shall be saved.

6 But we are all like an unclean thing, [.linebr]#/# +
and all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags. [.linebr]#/# +
And we all fade like a leaf. [.linebr]#/# +
And our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

7 And there is no one who calls upon your name, [.linebr]#/# +
who stirs up himself to take hold of you, [.linebr]#/# +
for you have hid your face from us [.linebr]#/# +
and have consumed us because of our iniquities.

8 But now, O LORD, you are our father. [.linebr]#/# +
We are the clay, and you our potter, [.linebr]#/# +
and we are all the work of your hand.

9 Do not be very angry, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
neither remember iniquity forever. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, see, we implore you, we are all your people.

10 Your holy cities are a wilderness. [.linebr]#/# +
Zion is a wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
Jerusalem a desolation.

11 Our holy and our beautiful house, [.linebr]#/# +
where our fathers praised you, [.linebr]#/# +
is burned with fire, [.linebr]#/# +
and all our pleasant things are laid waste.

12 Will you refrain yourself for these things, O LORD? [.linebr]#/# +
Will you hold your peace and grievously afflict us?

[[isa065-001]]1 "I am sought by those who did not ask for me. [.linebr]#/# +
I am found by those who did not seek me. [.linebr]#/# +
I said, 'Behold me, behold me,' [.linebr]#/# +
to a nation that was not called by my name.

[[isa065-002]]2 I have spread out my hands all the day [.linebr]#/# +
to a rebellious people, [.linebr]#/# +
which walks in a way that is not good [.linebr]#/# +
after their own thoughts,

3 A people who provokes me to anger [.linebr]#/# +
continually to my face, [.linebr]#/# +
who sacrifices in gardens [.linebr]#/# +
and burns incense upon altars of brick,

4 Who remain among the graves [.linebr]#/# +
and lodge in the monuments, [.linebr]#/# +
who eat swine's flesh [.linebr]#/# +
and broth of abominable things is in their vessels,

5 Who say, 'Stand by yourself, [.linebr]#/# +
do not come near me, for I am holier than you.' [.linebr]#/# +
These are a smoke in my nose, [.linebr]#/# +
a fire that burns all the day.

6 Behold, it is written before me. [.linebr]#/# +
I will not keep silence, but will recompense, [.linebr]#/# +
even recompense into their bosom,

7 Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
"who have burned incense upon the mountains [.linebr]#/# +
and blasphemed me upon the hills. [.linebr]#/# +
Therefore, I will measure their former work [.linebr]#/# +
into their bosom."

8 Thus says the LORD: [.linebr]#/# +
"As the new wine is found in the cluster, [.linebr]#/# +
and one says, 'Do not destroy it, [.linebr]#/# +
for a blessing is in it,' [.linebr]#/# +
so I will do for my servants' sake [.linebr]#/# +
so that I may not destroy them all.

9 And I will bring forth offspring out of Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains. [.linebr]#/# +
And my elect shall inherit it, [.linebr]#/# +
and my servants shall dwell there.

10 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, [.linebr]#/# +
and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, [.linebr]#/# +
for my people who have sought me.

11 But you are those who forsake the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
who forget my holy mountain, [.linebr]#/# +
who prepare a table for that troop, [.linebr]#/# +
and who furnish the drink-offering to that number.

12 Therefore, I will number you to the sword, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall all bow down to the slaughter. [.linebr]#/# +
Because when I called, you did not answer. [.linebr]#/# +
When I spoke, you did not hear, [.linebr]#/# +
but did evil before my eyes [.linebr]#/# +
and chose that in which I did not delight."

13 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: [.linebr]#/# +
"Behold, my servants shall eat, [.linebr]#/# +
but you shall be hungry. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, my servants shall drink, [.linebr]#/# +
but you shall be thirsty. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, my servants shall rejoice, [.linebr]#/# +
but you shall be ashamed.

14 Behold, my servants shall sing [.linebr]#/# +
for joy of heart, [.linebr]#/# +
but you shall cry for sorrow of heart [.linebr]#/# +
and howl for vexation of spirit.

15 And you shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen, [.linebr]#/# +
and the Lord GOD will slay you [.linebr]#/# +
and call his servants by another name,

16 So that he who blesses himself in the earth [.linebr]#/# +
shall bless himself in the God of truth, [.linebr]#/# +
and he who swears in the earth [.linebr]#/# +
shall swear by the God of truth, [.linebr]#/# +
because the former troubles are forgotten [.linebr]#/# +
and because they are hid from my eyes.

17 For behold, I create new heavens [.linebr]#/# +
and a new earth. [.linebr]#/# +
And the former shall not be remembered, [.linebr]#/# +
nor will they come into mind.

18 But be glad and rejoice forever [.linebr]#/# +
in that which I create. [.linebr]#/# +
For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing [.linebr]#/# +
and her people a joy.

19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem [.linebr]#/# +
and be glad in my people. [.linebr]#/# +
And there shall no longer be heard in her [.linebr]#/# +
the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.

20 No longer shall there be from there an infant of days [.linebr]#/# +
nor an old man who has not filled his days. [.linebr]#/# +
For the child shall die at a hundred years old, [.linebr]#/# +
but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.

21 And they shall build houses and inhabit them, [.linebr]#/# +
and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

22 They shall not build and another inhabit. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall not plant and another eat. [.linebr]#/# +
For the days of my people shall be like the days of a tree, [.linebr]#/# +
and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.

23 They shall not labor in vain, [.linebr]#/# +
nor bring forth for trouble, [.linebr]#/# +
for they are a people blessed by the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and their offspring with them.

24 And it shall come to pass, [.linebr]#/# +
that before they call, I will answer, [.linebr]#/# +
and while they are still speaking, I will hear.

25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, [.linebr]#/# +
and the lion shall eat straw like the bull, [.linebr]#/# +
and dust shall be the serpents' food. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall neither hurt nor destroy [.linebr]#/# +
in all my holy mountain," [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD.

"The heaven is my throne [.linebr]#/# +

Where is the house that you build for me? [.linebr]#/# +
And where is the place of my rest?

"But to this man I will look, [.linebr]#/# +
even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit [.linebr]#/# +

He who sacrifices a lamb is as if he cut off a dog's neck. [.linebr]#/# +
He who offers an oblation is as if he offered swine's blood. [.linebr]#/# +
He who burns incense is as if he blessed an idol. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, they have chosen their own ways, [.linebr]#/# +
and their soul delights in their abominations.

|

and will bring their fears upon them. [.linebr]#/# +
Because when I called, no one answered. [.linebr]#/# +
When I spoke, they did not hear. [.linebr]#/# +

who cast you out for my name's sake, said, [.linebr]#/# +
'Let the LORD be glorified, [.linebr]#/# +

a voice from the temple, [.linebr]#/# +
[it is] the voice of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
who renders recompense to his enemies.

|

Before her pain came, [.linebr]#/# +
she had delivered a male child.

|

Who has seen such things? [.linebr]#/# +
Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? [.linebr]#/# +
Or shall a nation be born at once? [.linebr]#/# +
For as soon as Zion travailed, [.linebr]#/# +
she brought forth her children.

|
|9 Shall I bring to the birth [.linebr]#/# +
and not cause to bring forth?" [.linebr]#/# +
says the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
"Shall I cause to bring forth [.linebr]#/# +
and shut the womb?" [.linebr]#/# +
says your God.

|

and be glad with her, all you who love her. [.linebr]#/# +
Rejoice for joy with her, [.linebr]#/# +
all you who mourn for her,

you shall be borne upon her sides [.linebr]#/# +

so I will comfort you, [.linebr]#/# +

and your bones shall flourish like an herb. [.linebr]#/# +
And the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, [.linebr]#/# +

and with his chariots like a whirlwind [.linebr]#/# +
to render his anger with fury [.linebr]#/# +
and his rebuke with flames of fire.

|
|16 For by fire and by his sword [.linebr]#/# +
the LORD will plead with all flesh. [.linebr]#/# +
And the slain of the LORD shall be many.

in the gardens, [.linebr]#/# +
following one in the midst, [.linebr]#/# +
eating swine's flesh, abominable things, and the mouse, [.linebr]#/# +
they shall be consumed together," [.linebr]#/# +

18 "For I know their works and their thoughts. The time comes that I will gather all nations and languages, and they shall come and see my glory. 19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who escape of them to the nations—to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal, to Javan, and to the coastlands afar off—who have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. 20 And they shall bring all your brothers for an offering to the LORD out of all nations upon horses, in chariots, in litters, upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem," says the LORD, "as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD. 21 And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites," says the LORD.
