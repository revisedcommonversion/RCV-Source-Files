*Zechariah | Ζαχαρίας | זכריה*

=== Chapter 1

[.outline.text-center]
_Zechariah exhorts to repentance, 1-6. The vision of the horses, 7-11. At the prayer of the angel comfortable promises are made to Jerusalem, 12-17. The vision of the four horns and the four craftsmen, 18-21._

1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, saying, 2 "The LORD has been greatly displeased with your fathers. 3 Therefore, say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Turn to me," says the LORD of hosts, "and I will turn to you," says the LORD of hosts. 4 "Do not be as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have cried, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Turn now from your evil ways and from your evil doings."' But they did not hear, nor listen to me," says the LORD. 5 "Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? 6 But my words and my statutes which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? And they returned and said, 'As the LORD of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways and according to our doings, so he has dealt with us.'"'"

7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, saying, 8 "I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom, and behind him there were red, speckled, and white horses. 9 Then I said, 'O my lord, what are these?'" And the angel who talked with me said to me, "I will show you what these are." 10 And the man who stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, "These are those whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth." 11 And they answered the angel of the LORD who stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, "We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sits still and is at rest."

12 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, "O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these seventy years?" 13 And the LORD answered the angel who talked with me with good words and comforting words. 14 So the angel who spoke with me said to me, "Cry, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: "I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. 15 And I am very greatly displeased with the heathen who are at ease. For I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction." 16 Therefore, thus says the LORD: "I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies. My house shall be built in it," says the LORD of hosts, "and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem."' 17 Cry again, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: "My cities through prosperity shall again be spread abroad, and the LORD shall again comfort Zion and shall again choose Jerusalem."'"

18 Then I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold four horns. 19 And I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these?" And he answered me, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem." 20 And the LORD showed me four craftsmen. 21 Then I said, "What are these coming to do?" And he spoke, saying, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifted up his head, but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the Gentiles which lifted their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it."

=== Chapter 2

[.outline.text-center]
_God, in the care of Jerusalem, sends to measure it, 1-5. The redemption of Zion, 6-9. The promise of God's presence, 10-13._

1 I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 2 Then I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what its breadth is and what its length is." 3 And behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 4 And said to him, "Run, speak to this young man, saying, 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and livestock in it. 5 For I,' says the LORD, 'will be to her a wall of fire on every side and will be the glory in the midst of her.'"

6 "Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north," says the LORD, "for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven," says the LORD. 7 "Deliver yourself, O Zion, who dwell with the daughter of Babylon." 8 For thus says the LORD of hosts: "After the glory he has sent me to the nations which wasted you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of his eye. 9 For behold, I will shake my hand upon them and they shall be plunder to their servants. And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me. 10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion. For behold, I come and I will dwell in the midst of you," says the LORD. 11 "And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day and shall be my people. And I will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. 12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land and shall choose Jerusalem again.

13 "Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD, for he is raised up out of his holy habitation."

=== Chapter 3

[.outline.text-center]
_Under the type of Joshua, the high priest, receiving clean garments, 1-5, and a covenant of promise, 6, 7, Christ the Branch and Corner Stone is promised, 8-10._

1 And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. 2 And the LORD said to Satan, "I, the LORD, rebuke you, O Satan. Even I, the LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you. Is this not a brand plucked out of the fire?" 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel. 4 And he answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, "Take away the filthy garments from him." And he said to him, "Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you and I will clothe you with costly clothing." 5 And I said, "Let them set a fair miter upon his head." So they set a fair miter upon his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.

6 And the angel of the LORD testified to Joshua, saying, 7 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'If you will walk in my ways and if you will keep my charge, then you shall also judge my house and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you places to walk among these who stand by.

8 'Hear now, O Joshua the high priest—you and your fellows who sit before you—for they are men wondered at. For behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. 9 For behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua, upon one stone shall be seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an engraving on it,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 10 In that day,' says the LORD of hosts, 'each of you shall call his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.'"

[.outline.text-center]
_By the golden candlestick is foreshown the good success of Zerubbabel's foundation, 1-10; by the two olive trees the two anointed ones, 11-14._

1 And the angel who talked with me came back and waked me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep, 2 And said to me, "What do you see?" And I said, "I have looked, and behold a candlestick, all of gold with a bowl on top of it, its seven lamps, and seven pipes to the seven lamps which were on top of it. 3 And two olive-trees by it: one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side." 4 So I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, "What are these, my lord?" 5 Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord." 6 Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, 'Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts. 7 'Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forth its head-stone with shoutings, crying, "Grace, grace to it."'"

8 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 9 "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it. And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. 10 For who has despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth."

11 Then I answered and said to him, "What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon its left side?" 12 And I answered again and said to him, "What are these two olive branches, which through the two golden pipes, empty the golden oil out of themselves?" 13 And he answered me and said, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord." 14 Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth."

=== Chapter 5

[.outline.text-center]
_By the flying scroll is shown the curse of thieves and swearers, 1-4; and by a woman pressed in an ephah the final judgment of wickedness, 5-11._

1 Then I turned, lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying scroll. 2 And he said to me, "What do you see?" And I answered, "I see a flying scroll. Its length is twenty cubits and its breadth ten cubits." 3 Then he said to me, "This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth. For everyone who steals shall be cut off as on this side according to it, and everyone who swears shall be cut off as on that side according to it. 4 I will bring it forth," says the LORD of hosts, "and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name. And it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it with its timber and its stones."

5 Then the angel who talked with me went forth and said to me, "Now lift up your eyes and see what this is that goes forth." 6 And I said, "What is it?" And he said, "This is an ephah that goes forth." He said moreover, "This is their resemblance through all the earth. 7 And behold, there was a talent of lead lifted up. And this is a woman who sits in the midst of the ephah." 8 And he said, "This is wickedness." And he cast it into the midst of the ephah, and he cast the weight of lead upon its mouth. 9 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings, for they had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. 10 Then I said to the angel who talked with me, "To where do these bear the ephah?" 11 And he said to me, "To build a house in the land of Shinar for it. And it shall be established and set there upon her own base."

=== Chapter 6

[.outline.text-center]
_The vision of the four chariots, 1-8. By the crowns of Joshua are shown the temple and kingdom of Christ the Branch, 9-15._

1 And I turned, lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains, and the mountains were mountains of brass. 2 In the first chariot there were red horses, in the second chariot black horses, 3 In the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot grizzled and bay horses. 4 Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?" 5 And the angel answered and said to me, "These are the four spirits of the heavens which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 6 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country, the white go forth after them, the grizzled go forth toward the south country." 7 And the bay went forth and sought to go so that they might walk to and fro through the earth. And he said, "Go from here, walk to and fro through the earth." So they walked to and fro through the earth. 8 Then he cried out to me and spoke to me, saying, "Behold, these which go toward the north country have quieted my Spirit in the north country."

9 And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 10 "Take from those who are in captivity, even from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, who have come from Babylon, and come the same day and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah.

11 "And you shall take silver and gold and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest. 12 And speak to him, saying, 'Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, "Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH, and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of the LORD. 13 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD, and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne. And he shall be a priest upon his throne. And the counsel of peace shall be between them both. 14 And the crowns shall be to Helem, to Tobijah, to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah for a memorial in the temple of the LORD. 15 And those who are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God."'"

=== Chapter 7

[.outline.text-center]
_The captives inquire concerning the set fasts, 1-3. Zechariah reproves the hypocrisy of their fasting, 4-7. Sin is the cause of their captivity, 8-14._

1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu, 2 When those of Beth-el had sent Sherezer, Regem-melech, and their men to pray before the LORD, 3 And to speak to the priests who were in the house of the LORD of hosts and to the prophets, saying, "Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?" 4 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 5 "Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did you at all fast to me, even to me? 6 And when you ate and when you drank, did you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves? 7 Should you not hear the words which the LORD has cried by the former prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, along with her cities around her, and when men inhabited the south and the plain?'"

8 And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying, 9 "Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, 'Execute true judgment and show mercy and compassions each to his brother. 10 And do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor, and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.' 11 But they refused to listen and withdrew the shoulder and stopped their ears so that they should not hear. 12 They even made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts has sent in his Spirit by the former prophets. Therefore, a great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. 13 Therefore, it has come to pass, that as he cried and they would not hear, so they cried and I would not hear," says the LORD of hosts. 14 "But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they did not know. Thus the land was desolate after them so that no man passed through nor returned, for they laid the pleasant land desolate."

=== Chapter 8

[.outline.text-center]
_The restoration of Jerusalem, 1-8. They are encouraged to build the temple by God's favor to them, 9-15. Good works are required of them, 16, 17. Joy and enlargement are promised, 18-23._

1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great fury.' 3 Thus says the LORD: 'I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain.' 4 Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'Old men and old women shall yet dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for abundance of age. 5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.' 6 Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes?' says the LORD of hosts. 7 Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country, 8 And I will bring them and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.'

9 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets who were in the day when the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, so that the temple might be built. 10 For before these days there was no hire for man nor any hire for beast, neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in because of the enemy, for I sent forth all men each against his neighbor. 11 But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days,' says the LORD of hosts. 12 'For the seed shall be prosperous, the vine shall give her fruit, the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew, and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. 13 And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not fear. Let your hands be strong.'

14 "For thus says the LORD of hosts: 'As I thought to punish you when your fathers provoked me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I did not repent, 15 So again I have thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear. [[zch008-016]]16 These are the things that you shall do: each of you speak the truth to his neighbor, execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates, 17 Let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath, for all these are things that I hate,' says the LORD."

18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 19 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'The fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth shall be joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts to the house of Judah; therefore, love the truth and peace.'

20 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people and the inhabitants of many cities. 21 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, "Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts. I will also go." 22 And many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to pray before the LORD.' 23 Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men out of all languages of the nations shall take hold, shall even take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, "We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."'"

4 Thus says the LORD my God: "Feed the flock of the slaughter, 5 Whose possessors slay them and do not hold themselves guilty. And those who sell them say, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich.' And their own shepherds do not pity them. 6 For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land," says the LORD, "but behold, I will deliver the men each into his neighbor's hand and into the hand of his king. And they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them."

7 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: one I called Beauty and the other I called Union. And I fed the flock. 8 I also cut off three shepherds in one month. My soul was impatient with them, and their soul also abhorred me. 9 Then I said, "I will not feed you. That which dies, let it die. And that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off. And let the rest eat the flesh of each other." 10 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it apart so that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. 11 And it was broken in that day. And so the poor of the flock who waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD. [[zch011-012]]12 And I said to them, "If you think good, give me my price, and if not, forbear." So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. [[zch011-013]]13 And the LORD said to me, "Cast it to the potter, the substantial price at which I was prized by them." And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD. 14 Then I cut apart my other staff, even Union, so that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

15 And the LORD said to me, "Take for yourself yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd. 16 For behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land who shall not visit those who are cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which stands still, but he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their hooves in pieces.

_Jerusalem a cup of trembling to herself, 1, 2, and a burdensome stone to her adversaries, 3-5. The victorious restoring of Judah, 6-9. The repentance of Jerusalem, 10-14._

1 [_The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel._] Thus says the LORD who stretches forth the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him:

2 "Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the people around, and it shall also be upon Judah in the siege against Jerusalem. 3 And in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people. All who burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth are assembled against it. 4 In that day," says the LORD, "I will smite every horse with astonishment and his rider with madness. And I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. 5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, 'The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.'

6 "In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheaf, and they shall devour all the people around, on the right hand and on the left. And Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem. 7 The LORD will also save the tents of Judah first so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not magnify themselves against Judah. 8 In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and he who is feeble among them at that day shall be as David, and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them. 9 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

[[zch012-010]]10 "And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplications. And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him as one who is in bitterness for his first-born. 11 In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. 12 And the land shall mourn, every family separately: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; 13 The family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself, and their wives by themselves; 14 All the families that remain, every family by itself, and their wives by themselves."

_The fountain of cleansing for Jerusalem, 1, from idolatry and false prophecy, 2-6. The death of Christ, and the trial of a third part, 7-9._

1 "In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.

2 "And it shall come to pass in that day," says the LORD of hosts, "that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no longer be remembered. And I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. 3 And it shall come to pass, that if anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who begot him shall say to him, 'You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of the LORD.' And his father and his mother who begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesies. 4 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall each be ashamed of his vision when he has prophesied, and they shall not wear a rough garment to deceive, 5 But he shall say, 'I am no prophet. I am a tiller of the ground, for I have been made a servant from my youth.' 6 And someone shall say to him, 'What are these wounds between your hands?' Then he shall answer, 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.'

=== Chapter 14

[.outline.text-center]
_The destroyers of Jerusalem destroyed, 1, 2. The coming of Christ and the graces of his kingdom, 3-11. The plague of Jerusalem's enemies, 12-15. The remnant shall turn to the Lord, 16-19 and there shall be universal holiness among them, 20, 21._

1 Behold, the day of the LORD comes, and your plunder shall be divided in the midst of you. 2 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken, the houses plundered, and the women ravished. Half of the city shall go forth into captivity, but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city. 3 Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. 4 And his feet will stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east. And the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst of it toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley. Half of the mountain shall move toward the north and half of it toward the south. 5 And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. Indeed, you shall flee as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.

6 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark. 7 But it shall be one day which is known to the LORD, neither day, nor night, but it shall come to pass, that at evening it shall be light.

8 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem: half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the western sea. In summer and in winter it shall be.

9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth. In that day there will be one LORD, and his name one.

10 All the land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem. And it shall be lifted up and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's wine-presses. 11 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall no longer be utter destruction. And Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.

12 And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the people who have fought against Jerusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. 13 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them, and they shall each lay hold upon the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor. 14 And Judah shall also fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the heathen around shall be collected: gold, silver, and apparel in great abundance. 15 And so the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, of the donkey, and of all the beasts that will be in these tents, shall be as this plague.

16 And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. 17 And it shall be, that whoever will not come up of all the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there shall be no rain upon them. 18 And if the family of Egypt shall not go up and shall not come, they shall have no rain. There the plague shall be, with which the LORD will smite the heathen who do not come up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all nations that do not come up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

20 In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, "HOLINESS TO THE LORD," and the pots in the LORD'S house shall be like the bowls before the altar. 21 Even every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to the LORD of hosts. And all those who sacrifice shall come and take some of them and boil in them. And in that day the Canaanite shall no longer be in the house of the LORD of hosts.
