=== Psalm 1

[.outline.text-center]
_The happiness of the godly, 1-3. The unhappiness of the ungodly, 4-6._

1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly, [.linebr]#/# +
nor stands in the way of sinners, [.linebr]#/# +
nor sits in the seat of scoffers.

2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and on his law he meditates day and night.

3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water [.linebr]#/# +
that brings forth its fruit in season, [.linebr]#/# +
and its leaf shall not wither. [.linebr]#/# +
And whatever he does shall prosper.

4 The ungodly are not so, [.linebr]#/# +
but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.

5 Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, [.linebr]#/# +
nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

6 For the LORD knows the way of the righteous. [.linebr]#/# +
But the way of the ungodly shall perish.

[#psa002%breakable]
=== Psalm 2

[.outline.text-center]
_The kingdom of Christ, 1-9. Kings are exhorted to accept it, 10-12._

[[psa002-001]]1 Why do the heathen rage [.linebr]#/# +
and the people plot a vain thing?

[[psa002-002]]2 The kings of the earth set themselves, [.linebr]#/# +
and the rulers take counsel together [.linebr]#/# +
against the LORD and against his anointed, saying,

3 "Let us break their bonds apart [.linebr]#/# +
and cast away their cords from us."

4 He who sits in the heavens shall laugh. [.linebr]#/# +
The Lord shall have them in derision.

5 Then he shall speak to them in his wrath [.linebr]#/# +
and trouble them in his sore displeasure.

6 "Yet I have set my king [.linebr]#/# +
upon my holy hill of Zion.

[[psa002-007]]7 I will declare the decree. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD has said to me, 'You are my Son. [.linebr]#/# +
This day I have begotten you.

[[psa002-008]]8 Ask of me, and I will give you the heathen for your inheritance [.linebr]#/# +
and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.

[[psa002-009]]9 You shall break them with a rod of iron. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.'"

10 Now therefore, be wise, O kings. [.linebr]#/# +
Be instructed, you judges of the earth.

11 Serve the LORD with fear [.linebr]#/# +
and rejoice with trembling.

12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish from the way, [.linebr]#/# +
for his wrath may soon be kindled. [.linebr]#/# +
Blessed are all those who put their trust in him.

=== Psalm 3

[.outline.text-center]
_The security of God's protection, 1-8._

1 [_A Psalm of David: when he fled from Absalom his son._]

LORD, how those who trouble me are multiplied! [.linebr]#/# +
Many are those who rise up against me.

2 There are many who say of my soul, [.linebr]#/# +
"There is no help for him in God." [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

3 But you, O LORD, are a shield for me, [.linebr]#/# +
my glory and the lifter up of my head.

4 I cried to the LORD with my voice, [.linebr]#/# +
and he heard me from his holy hill. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

5 I laid myself down and slept. [.linebr]#/# +
I awoke, for the LORD sustained me.

6 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people [.linebr]#/# +
who have set themselves against me on all sides.

7 Arise, O LORD. Save me, O my God. [.linebr]#/# +
For you have smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone. [.linebr]#/# +
You have broken the teeth of the ungodly.

8 Salvation belongs to the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Your blessing is upon your people. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

=== Psalm 4

[.outline.text-center]
_David prays for audience, 1. He reproves and exhorts his enemies, 2-5. Man's happiness is in God's favor, 6-8._

1 [_To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. A Psalm of David._]

Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness. [.linebr]#/# +
You have enlarged me when I was in distress. [.linebr]#/# +
Have mercy upon me and hear my prayer.

2 O sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame? [.linebr]#/# +
How long will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

3 But know that the LORD has set apart him who is godly for himself. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD will hear when I call to him.

[[psa004-004]]4 Stand in awe and do not sin. [.linebr]#/# +
Speak with your own heart upon your bed and be still. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness [.linebr]#/# +
and put your trust in the LORD.

6 There are many who say, "Who will show us any good?" [.linebr]#/# +
LORD, lift upon us the light of your countenance.

7 You have put gladness in my heart, [.linebr]#/# +
more than in the time when their grain and their wine increased.

8 I will both lay myself down in peace and sleep, [.linebr]#/# +
for you only, LORD, make me dwell in safety.

=== Psalm 5

[.outline.text-center]
_David prays and professes his diligence in prayer, 1-3. God does not favor the wicked, 4-6. David, professing his faith, prays to God to guide him, 7-9; to destroy his enemies, 10; and to preserve the godly, 11, 12._

1 [_To the Chief Musician upon Nehiloth. A Psalm of David._]

Give ear to my words, O LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Consider my meditation.

2 Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God. [.linebr]#/# +
For to you I will pray.

3 My voice you shall hear in the morning, O LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
In the morning I will direct my prayer to you and will look up.

4 For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall evil dwell with you.

5 The foolish shall not stand in your sight. [.linebr]#/# +
You hate all workers of iniquity.

6 You shall destroy those who speak falsehood. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

7 But as for me, I will come into your house [.linebr]#/# +
in the multitude of your mercy, [.linebr]#/# +
and in your fear I will worship [.linebr]#/# +
toward your holy temple.

8 Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies. [.linebr]#/# +
Make your way straight before my face.

[[psa005-009]]9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. [.linebr]#/# +
Their inward part is wickedness. [.linebr]#/# +
Their throat is an open sepulcher. [.linebr]#/# +
They flatter with their tongue.

10 Destroy them, O God. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them fall by their own counsels. [.linebr]#/# +
Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions. [.linebr]#/# +
For they have rebelled against you.

11 But let all those who put their trust in you rejoice. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them always shout for joy because you defend them. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.

12 For you, LORD, will bless the righteous. [.linebr]#/# +
With favor you will compass him as with a shield.

=== Psalm 6

[.outline.text-center]
_David's complaint in his sickness, 1-7. He triumphs over his enemies, 8-10._

1 [_To the Chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith. A Psalm of David._]

O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger, [.linebr]#/# +
neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.

2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am weak. [.linebr]#/# +
O LORD, heal me, for my bones are agitated.

[[psa006-003]]3 My soul is also greatly disquieted. [.linebr]#/# +
But you, O LORD, how long?

4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul. [.linebr]#/# +
Oh save me for your mercy's sake.

5 For in death there is no remembrance of you. [.linebr]#/# +
In the grave, who will give you thanks?

6 I am weary with my groaning. [.linebr]#/# +
All the night I make my bed to swim. [.linebr]#/# +
I water my couch with my tears.

7 My eye is consumed because of grief. [.linebr]#/# +
It grows old because of all my enemies.

[[psa006-008]]8 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.

9 The LORD has heard my supplication. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD will receive my prayer.

10 Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly disquieted. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them return and be suddenly ashamed.

=== Psalm 7

[.outline.text-center]
_David prays against the malice of his enemies, professing his innocence, 1-9. By faith he sees his defense and the destruction of his enemies, 10-17._

[[psa007-001]]1 [_Shiggaion of David: which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite._]

O LORD my God, I put my trust in you. [.linebr]#/# +
Save me from all those who persecute me, and deliver me,

2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, [.linebr]#/# +
rending it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver.

3 O LORD my God, if I have done this, [.linebr]#/# +
if there is iniquity in my hands,

4 If I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me [.linebr]#/# +
(I have even delivered him who without cause is my enemy),

5 Let the enemy persecute my soul and take it. [.linebr]#/# +
Let him even tread down my life upon the earth [.linebr]#/# +
and lay my honor in the dust. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

6 Arise, O LORD, in your anger, [.linebr]#/# +
lift up yourself because of the rage of my enemies, [.linebr]#/# +
and awake for me to the judgment that you have commanded.

7 And the congregation of the people shall encompass you. [.linebr]#/# +
For their sakes therefore return on high.

8 The LORD shall judge the people. [.linebr]#/# +
Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness [.linebr]#/# +
and according to my integrity that is in me.

9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, [.linebr]#/# +
but establish the just, [.linebr]#/# +
for the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.

10 My defense is from God, [.linebr]#/# +
who saves the upright in heart.

11 God judges the righteous, [.linebr]#/# +
and God is angry with the wicked every day.

12 If he does not turn, he will whet his sword. [.linebr]#/# +
He has bent his bow and made it ready.

13 He has also prepared for him the instruments of death. [.linebr]#/# +
He ordains his arrows against the persecutors.

14 Behold, he travails with iniquity, [.linebr]#/# +
has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

15 He made a pit, dug it, [.linebr]#/# +
and has fallen into the ditch which he made.

16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, [.linebr]#/# +
and his violent dealing shall come down upon the crown of his own head.

17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness [.linebr]#/# +
and sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

=== Psalm 8

[.outline.text-center]
_God's glory is magnified by his works and by his love to man, 1-9._

1 [_To the Chief Musician upon Gittith. A Psalm of David._]

O Yahweh our Lord, [.linebr]#/# +
how excellent your name is in all the earth! [.linebr]#/# +
You have set your glory above the heavens.

[[psa008-002]]2 Out of the mouth of babies and infants you have ordained strength [.linebr]#/# +
because of your enemies, [.linebr]#/# +
so that you might still the enemy and the avenger.

3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, [.linebr]#/# +
the moon and the stars, which you have ordained,

[[psa008-004]]4 What is man that you are mindful of him, [.linebr]#/# +
and the son of man that you visit him?

[[psa008-005]]5 For you have made him a little lower than the angels [.linebr]#/# +
and have crowned him with glory and honor.

[[psa008-006]]6 You have made him to have dominion over the works of your hands. [.linebr]#/# +
You have put all things under his feet:

7 All sheep and oxen [.linebr]#/# +
and even the beasts of the field,

8 The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, [.linebr]#/# +
and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.

9 O Yahweh our Lord, [.linebr]#/# +
how excellent your name is in all the earth!

=== Psalm 9

[.outline.text-center]
_David praises God for executing judgment, 1-10. He incites others to praise him, 11, 12. He prays that he may have cause to praise him, 13-20._

1 [_To the Chief Musician upon Muthlabben. A Psalm of David._]

I will praise you, O LORD, with my whole heart. [.linebr]#/# +
I will show forth all your wonderful works.

2 I will be glad and rejoice in you. [.linebr]#/# +
I will sing praise to your name, O most High.

3 When my enemies are turned back, [.linebr]#/# +
they shall fall and perish at your presence.

4 For you have maintained my right and my cause. [.linebr]#/# +
You sat on the throne judging right.

5 You have rebuked the heathen, [.linebr]#/# +
you have destroyed the wicked, [.linebr]#/# +
you have blotted out their name forever and ever.

6 O enemy, destructions have come to a perpetual end, [.linebr]#/# +
and you have destroyed cities. [.linebr]#/# +
Their memorial has perished with them.

7 But the LORD shall endure forever. [.linebr]#/# +
He has prepared his throne for judgment.

8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

9 The LORD will also be a refuge for the oppressed, [.linebr]#/# +
a refuge in times of trouble.

10 And those who know your name will put their trust in you, [.linebr]#/# +
for you, LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.

11 Sing praises to the LORD who dwells in Zion. [.linebr]#/# +
Declare among the people his doings.

12 For he who avenges blood remembers them. [.linebr]#/# +
He does not forget the cry of the humble.

13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Consider my trouble which I suffer from those who hate me, [.linebr]#/# +
and lift me up from the gates of death

14 So that I may show forth all your praise [.linebr]#/# +
in the gates of the daughter of Zion. [.linebr]#/# +
I will rejoice in your salvation.

15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made. [.linebr]#/# +
In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.

16 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executes. [.linebr]#/# +
The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Higgaion. Selah._ +]+

17 The wicked shall be turned into hell— [.linebr]#/# +
all the nations who forget God.

18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten. [.linebr]#/# +
The expectation of the poor shall not perish forever.

19 Arise, O LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not let man prevail. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the heathen be judged in your sight.

20 Put them in fear, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
so that the nations may know themselves to be only men. [.linebr]#/# +

[#psa010%breakable]
=== Psalm 10

[.outline.text-center]
_David accuses the wicked, 1-11. He prays for remedy, 12-15. He professes his confidence, 16-18._

1 Why do you stand afar off, O LORD? [.linebr]#/# +
Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?

2 The wicked in his pride persecutes the poor. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.

3 For the wicked boasts about his heart's desire [.linebr]#/# +
and blesses the covetous, whom the LORD abhors.

4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, [.linebr]#/# +
will not seek after God. [.linebr]#/# +
God is not in all his thoughts.

5 His ways are always grievous. [.linebr]#/# +
Your judgments are far above out of his sight. [.linebr]#/# +
As for all his enemies, he puffs at them.

6 He has said in his heart, "I shall not be moved, [.linebr]#/# +
for I shall never be in adversity."

[[psa010-007]]7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud. [.linebr]#/# +
Under his tongue is mischief and vanity.

8 He sits in the lurking places of the villages. [.linebr]#/# +
In the secret places he murders the innocent. [.linebr]#/# +
His eyes are secretly set against the poor.

9 He lies in wait secretly like a lion in his den. [.linebr]#/# +
He lies in wait to catch the poor. [.linebr]#/# +
He catches the poor when he draws him into his net.

10 He crouches and humbles himself [.linebr]#/# +
so that the poor may fall by his strong ones.

11 He has said in his heart, "God has forgotten. [.linebr]#/# +
He hides his face. He will never see it."

12 Arise, O LORD. O God, lift up your hand. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not forget the humble.

13 Why does the wicked despise God? [.linebr]#/# +
He has said in his heart, "You will not require it."

14 You have seen it, [.linebr]#/# +
for you behold mischief and spite to requite it with your hand. [.linebr]#/# +
The poor commits himself to you. [.linebr]#/# +
You are the helper of the fatherless.

15 Break the arm of the wicked and the evil man. [.linebr]#/# +
Seek out his wickedness until you find none.

16 The LORD is King forever and ever. [.linebr]#/# +
The heathen have perished out of his land.

17 LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble. [.linebr]#/# +
You will prepare their heart. [.linebr]#/# +
You will cause your ear to hear,

18 Doing justice for the fatherless and the oppressed [.linebr]#/# +
so that the man of the earth may no longer oppress.

2 For behold, the wicked bend their bow. [.linebr]#/# +

Help, LORD, for the godly man ceases, [.linebr]#/# +
for the faithful fail from among the children of men.

2 They each speak vanity with his neighbor. [.linebr]#/# +
With flattering lips and with a double heart they speak.

3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips [.linebr]#/# +

Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?"

like silver tried in a furnace of earth, [.linebr]#/# +
purified seven times.

How long will you hide your face from me?

2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, [.linebr]#/# +

How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?

[[psa014-001]]1 [_To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David._]

The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." [.linebr]#/# +
They are corrupt. They have done abominable works. [.linebr]#/# +
There is no one who does good.

2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men [.linebr]#/# +
to see if there were any who understood and sought God.

3 They have all gone aside. [.linebr]#/# +
They have all together become filthy. [.linebr]#/# +
There is no one who does good, not even one.

4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, [.linebr]#/# +
who eat up my people like they eat bread [.linebr]#/# +

5 There they were in great fear, [.linebr]#/# +
for God is in the generation of the righteous.

6 You have shamed the counsel of the poor [.linebr]#/# +

[.outline.text-center]
_David, in confidence of his integrity, craves defense from God against his enemies, 1-9. He shows their pride, craft, and eagerness, 10-12. He prays against them in confidence of his hope, 13-15._

1 [_A Prayer of David._]

Hear the right, O LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Attend to my cry. [.linebr]#/# +
Give ear to my prayer, [.linebr]#/# +
which does not go out of feigned lips.

2 Let my sentence come forth from your presence. [.linebr]#/# +
Let your eyes behold the things that are equal.

3 You have proved my heart. [.linebr]#/# +
You have visited me in the night. [.linebr]#/# +
You have tried me and shall find nothing. [.linebr]#/# +
I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

4 Concerning the works of men, [.linebr]#/# +
by the word of your lips [.linebr]#/# +
I have kept myself from the paths of the destroyer.

5 Uphold my goings in your paths [.linebr]#/# +
so that my footsteps do not slip.

6 I have called upon you, for you will hear me, O God. [.linebr]#/# +
Incline your ear to me and hear my speech.

7 Show your wonderful loving-kindness, [.linebr]#/# +
O you who save by your right hand [.linebr]#/# +
those who put their trust in you [.linebr]#/# +
from those who rise up against them.

8 Keep me as the apple of your eye. [.linebr]#/# +
Hide me under the shadow of your wings

9 From the wicked who oppress me, [.linebr]#/# +
from my deadly enemies who encompass me.

10 They are enclosed in their own fat. [.linebr]#/# +
They speak proudly with their mouth.

11 They have now compassed us in our steps. [.linebr]#/# +
They have set their eyes bowing down to the earth,

12 Like a lion that is greedy of his prey, [.linebr]#/# +
like a young lion lurking in secret places.

13 Arise, O LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Disappoint him. Cast him down. [.linebr]#/# +
Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,

14 From men who are your hand, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
from men of the world who have their portion in this life [.linebr]#/# +
and whose belly you fill with your hidden treasure. [.linebr]#/# +
They are full of children [.linebr]#/# +
and leave the rest of their substance to their babies.

15 As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness. [.linebr]#/# +
I shall be satisfied with your likeness when I awake.

=== Psalm 18

[.outline.text-center]
_David praises God for his manifold and marvelous blessings, 1-50._

1 [_To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the Servant of the LORD: who spoke the words of this song to the LORD in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said,_]

I will love you, O LORD, my strength.

2 The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, [.linebr]#/# +
my God, my strength in whom I will trust, [.linebr]#/# +
my buckler, the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.

3 I will call upon the LORD who is worthy to be praised. [.linebr]#/# +
So I shall be saved from my enemies.

4 The sorrows of death compassed me, [.linebr]#/# +
and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.

5 The sorrows of hell encompassed me. [.linebr]#/# +
The snares of death seized me.

6 In my distress I called upon the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and cried to my God. [.linebr]#/# +
He heard my voice out of his temple, [.linebr]#/# +
and my cry came before him, even into his ears.

7 Then the earth shook and trembled, [.linebr]#/# +
and also the foundations of the hills moved [.linebr]#/# +
and were shaken, because he was angry.

8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, [.linebr]#/# +
and fire out of his mouth devoured. [.linebr]#/# +
Coals were kindled by it.

9 He also bowed the heavens and came down, [.linebr]#/# +
and darkness was under his feet.

10 And he rode upon a cherub and flew. [.linebr]#/# +
He even flew upon the wings of the wind.

11 He made darkness his secret place, his pavilion around him, [.linebr]#/# +
dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed [.linebr]#/# +
with hail stones and coals of fire.

13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, [.linebr]#/# +
and the Highest gave his voice [.linebr]#/# +
with hail stones and coals of fire.

14 He even sent out his arrows and scattered them, [.linebr]#/# +
and he shot out lightnings and completely defeated them.

15 Then the channels of waters were seen [.linebr]#/# +
and the foundations of the world were uncovered [.linebr]#/# +
at your rebuke, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

16 He sent from above, he took me, [.linebr]#/# +
he drew me out of many waters.

17 He delivered me from my strong enemy [.linebr]#/# +
and from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.

18 They attacked me in the day of my calamity, [.linebr]#/# +
but the LORD was my stay.

19 He also brought me forth in a large place. [.linebr]#/# +
He delivered me because he delighted in me.

20 The LORD rewarded me [.linebr]#/# +
according to my righteousness. [.linebr]#/# +
According to the cleanness of my hands [.linebr]#/# +
he has recompensed me.

21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and have not wickedly departed from my God.

22 For all his judgments were before me, [.linebr]#/# +
and I did not put away his statutes from me.

23 I was also upright before him [.linebr]#/# +
and I kept myself from my iniquity.

24 Therefore, the LORD has recompensed me [.linebr]#/# +
according to my righteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.

25 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. [.linebr]#/# +
With an upright man you will show yourself upright.

26 With the pure you will show yourself pure. [.linebr]#/# +
With the perverse you will contend.

27 For you will save the afflicted people, [.linebr]#/# +
but will bring down high looks.

28 For you will light my candle. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.

29 For by you I have run through a troop. [.linebr]#/# +
And by my God I have leaped over a wall.

30 As for God, his way is perfect. [.linebr]#/# +
The word of the LORD is tried. [.linebr]#/# +
He is a buckler to all those who trust in him.

31 For who is God except the LORD? [.linebr]#/# +
Or who is a rock except our God?

32 It is God who girds me with strength [.linebr]#/# +
and makes my way perfect.

33 He makes my feet like those of a doe [.linebr]#/# +
and sets me upon my high places.

34 He teaches my hands to war [.linebr]#/# +
so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.

35 You have also given me the shield of your salvation. [.linebr]#/# +
Your right hand has held me up, [.linebr]#/# +
and your gentleness has made me great.

36 You have enlarged my steps under me, [.linebr]#/# +
and my feet have not slipped.

37 I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them, [.linebr]#/# +
neither did I turn back until they were consumed.

38 I have wounded them so that they were not able to rise. [.linebr]#/# +
They have fallen under my feet.

39 For you have girded me with strength to battle. [.linebr]#/# +
You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.

40 You have also given me the necks of my enemies [.linebr]#/# +
so that I might destroy those who hate me.

41 They cried, but there was no one to save them, [.linebr]#/# +
even to the LORD, but he did not answer them.

42 Then I beat them as small as the dust before the wind. [.linebr]#/# +
I cast them out like the dirt in the streets.

43 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people [.linebr]#/# +
and you have made me the head of the heathen. [.linebr]#/# +
A people whom I have not known shall serve me.

44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me. [.linebr]#/# +
The strangers shall submit themselves to me.

45 The strangers shall fade away [.linebr]#/# +
and be afraid from their strongholds.

46 The LORD lives. Blessed be my rock. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the God of my salvation be exalted.

47 It is God who avenges me [.linebr]#/# +
and subdues the people under me.

48 He delivers me from my enemies. [.linebr]#/# +
You even lift me up above those who rise up against me. [.linebr]#/# +
You have delivered me from the violent man.

[[psa018-049]]49 Therefore, I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the heathen [.linebr]#/# +
and sing praises to your name.

50 He gives great deliverance to his king [.linebr]#/# +
and shows mercy to his anointed, [.linebr]#/# +
to David, and to his offspring forever.

1 [_To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David._]

The heavens declare the glory of God, [.linebr]#/# +
and the firmament shows the work of his hands.

2 Day to day utters speech, [.linebr]#/# +
and night to night shows knowledge.

3 There is no speech nor language [.linebr]#/# +

[[psa019-004]]4 Their line has gone out through all the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and their words to the end of the world. [.linebr]#/# +

5 It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber. [.linebr]#/# +
It rejoices like a strong man running a race.

6 Its going forth is from the end of the heaven, [.linebr]#/# +
and its circuit to the ends of it, [.linebr]#/# +
and there is nothing hid from its heat.

7 The law of the LORD is perfect, [.linebr]#/# +
converting the soul. [.linebr]#/# +
The testimony of the LORD is sure, [.linebr]#/# +
making the simple wise.

8 The statutes of the LORD are right, [.linebr]#/# +
rejoicing the heart. [.linebr]#/# +
The commandment of the LORD is pure, [.linebr]#/# +
enlightening the eyes.

[[psa019-009]]9 The fear of the LORD is clean, [.linebr]#/# +
enduring forever. [.linebr]#/# +
The judgments of the LORD are true, [.linebr]#/# +
being altogether righteous.

10 They are to be more desired than gold, [.linebr]#/# +
even much fine gold, [.linebr]#/# +
and also sweeter than honey [.linebr]#/# +
and the honey-comb.

11 Moreover, by them your servant is warned, [.linebr]#/# +
and in keeping them there is great reward.

12 Who can understand his errors? [.linebr]#/# +
Cleanse me from secret faults.

13 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not let them have dominion over me. [.linebr]#/# +
Then I shall be upright [.linebr]#/# +
and be innocent from the great transgression.

14 Let the words of my mouth [.linebr]#/# +

Why are you so far from helping me [.linebr]#/# +
and from the words of my roaring?

2 O my God, I cry in the day-time, but you do not hear, [.linebr]#/# +

3 But you are holy, [.linebr]#/# +
O you who inhabit the praises of Israel.

4 Our fathers trusted in you. [.linebr]#/# +
They trusted, and you delivered them.

5 They cried to you and were delivered. [.linebr]#/# +
They trusted in you and were not confounded.

6 But I am a worm and no man, [.linebr]#/# +
a reproach of men and despised by the people.

7 All those who see me deride me. [.linebr]#/# +
They shoot out the lip and shake the head, saying,

[[psa022-008]]8 "He trusted in the LORD that he would deliver him. [.linebr]#/# +
Let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him."

9 But you are he who brought me forth into life. [.linebr]#/# +

10 I was cast upon you from my birth. [.linebr]#/# +
You are my God from the time I was born.

11 Do not be far from me, for trouble is near. [.linebr]#/# +
For there is no one to help.

12 Many bulls have surrounded me. [.linebr]#/# +
Strong bulls of Bashan have compassed me.

13 They gaped upon me with their mouths [.linebr]#/# +

14 I am poured out like water, [.linebr]#/# +
and all my bones are out of joint. [.linebr]#/# +
My heart is like wax. [.linebr]#/# +
It is melted in the midst of my body.

15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, [.linebr]#/# +

And you have brought me into the dust of death.

neither has he hid his face from him. [.linebr]#/# +
But when he cried to him, he heard.

25 My praise shall be of you in the great congregation. [.linebr]#/# +
I will pay my vows before those who fear him.

26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall praise the LORD who seek him. [.linebr]#/# +

[.outline.text-center]
_David resorts to God in confidence of his integrity, 1-12._

1 [_A Psalm of David._]

Judge me, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
for I have walked in my integrity. [.linebr]#/# +
I have also trusted in the LORD; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, I shall not slide.

2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me. [.linebr]#/# +
Try my mind and my heart.

3 For your loving-kindness is before my eyes, [.linebr]#/# +
and I have walked in your truth.

4 I have not sat with vain persons, [.linebr]#/# +
neither will I go in with dissemblers.

5 I have hated the congregation of evildoers [.linebr]#/# +
and will not sit with the wicked.

6 I will wash my hands in innocence [.linebr]#/# +
and will compass your altar, O LORD,

7 So that I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving [.linebr]#/# +
and tell of all your wondrous works.

8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of your house [.linebr]#/# +
and the place where your honor dwells.

9 Do not gather my soul with sinners [.linebr]#/# +
nor my life with bloody men,

10 In whose hands is mischief, [.linebr]#/# +
and their right hand is full of bribes.

11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. [.linebr]#/# +
Redeem me and be merciful to me.

12 My foot stands in an even place. [.linebr]#/# +
In the congregations I will bless the LORD.

=== Psalm 27

[.outline.text-center]
_David sustains his faith by prayer, 1-14._

1 [_A Psalm of David._]

The LORD is my light and my salvation. [.linebr]#/# +
Whom shall I fear? [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD is the strength of my life. [.linebr]#/# +
Of whom shall I be afraid?

2 When the wicked, [.linebr]#/# +
even my enemies and my foes, [.linebr]#/# +
came upon me to eat up my flesh, [.linebr]#/# +
they stumbled and fell.

3 Though a host should encamp against me, [.linebr]#/# +
my heart shall not fear. [.linebr]#/# +
Though war should rise against me, [.linebr]#/# +
in this I will be confident.

4 One thing I have desired of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
that I will seek after: [.linebr]#/# +
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
all the days of my life [.linebr]#/# +
to behold the beauty of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and to inquire in his temple.

5 For in the time of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion. [.linebr]#/# +
In the secret of his tabernacle he will hide me. [.linebr]#/# +
He will set me up upon a rock.

6 And now my head shall be lifted [.linebr]#/# +
above my enemies around me; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. [.linebr]#/# +
I will sing, I will even sing praises to the LORD.

7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice, [.linebr]#/# +
and have mercy upon me and answer me.

8 When you said, "Seek my face," my heart said to you, [.linebr]#/# +
"Your face, LORD, I will seek."

9 Do not hide your face from me. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not put your servant away in anger. [.linebr]#/# +
You have been my help. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not leave me, neither forsake me, [.linebr]#/# +
O God of my salvation.

10 When my father and my mother forsake me, [.linebr]#/# +
the LORD will take me up.

11 Teach me your way, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and lead me in a plain path [.linebr]#/# +
because of my enemies.

12 Do not deliver me over to the will of my enemies, [.linebr]#/# +
for false witnesses have risen against me, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who breathe out cruelty.

13 I would have fainted unless I had believed to see [.linebr]#/# +
the goodness of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
in the land of the living.

14 Wait for the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Be of good courage, and he will strengthen your heart. [.linebr]#/# +
Wait, I say, for the LORD.

_David prays earnestly against his enemies, 1-5; and for the people, 6-9._

1 [_A Psalm of David._]

To you I will cry, O LORD my rock. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not be silent to me, [.linebr]#/# +
lest, if you are silent to me, [.linebr]#/# +
I become like those who go down into the pit.

2 Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you, [.linebr]#/# +
when I lift my hands toward your holy oracle.

3 Do not draw me away with the wicked [.linebr]#/# +
and with the workers of iniquity, [.linebr]#/# +
who speak peace to their neighbors, [.linebr]#/# +
but mischief is in their hearts.

4 Give them according to their deeds [.linebr]#/# +
and according to the wickedness of their endeavors. [.linebr]#/# +
Give them after the work of their hands. [.linebr]#/# +
Render to them what they deserve.

5 Because they do not regard the works of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
nor the operation of his hands, [.linebr]#/# +
he will destroy them and not build them up.

6 Blessed be the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
because he has heard the voice of my supplications.

7 The LORD is my strength and my shield. [.linebr]#/# +
My heart trusted in him, and I am helped; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, my heart greatly rejoices, [.linebr]#/# +
and with my song I will praise him.

8 The LORD is their strength, [.linebr]#/# +
and he is the saving strength of his anointed.

9 Save your people and bless your inheritance. [.linebr]#/# +
Feed them also and lift them up forever.

Give to the LORD, O you mighty, [.linebr]#/# +
give to the LORD glory and strength.

2 Give to the LORD the glory due to his name. [.linebr]#/# +
Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.

3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters. [.linebr]#/# +
The God of glory thunders. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD is upon many waters.

4 The voice of the LORD is powerful. [.linebr]#/# +
The voice of the LORD is full of majesty.

5 The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD even breaks the cedars of Lebanon.

6 He makes them also to skip like a calf, [.linebr]#/# +
Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.

7 The voice of the LORD divides the flames of fire.

8 The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.

9 The voice of the LORD makes the deer bring forth [.linebr]#/# +
and makes the forests bare. [.linebr]#/# +
And in his temple everyone speaks of his glory.

10 The LORD sits upon the flood. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD even sits king forever.

The LORD will bless his people with peace.

_David praises God for his deliverance, 1-3. He exhorts others to praise him by example of God's dealings with him, 4-12._

1 [_A Psalm and Song: for the dedication of the house of David._]

I will extol you, O LORD, for you have lifted me up [.linebr]#/# +
and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.

2 O LORD my God, [.linebr]#/# +
I cried to you, and you have healed me.

3 O LORD, you have brought up my soul from the grave. [.linebr]#/# +
You have kept me alive [.linebr]#/# +
so that I should not go down to the pit.

4 Sing to the LORD, O saints of his, [.linebr]#/# +
and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

5 For his anger endures only a moment. [.linebr]#/# +
In his favor is life. [.linebr]#/# +
Weeping may endure for a night, [.linebr]#/# +
but joy comes in the morning.

6 And in my prosperity, I said, [.linebr]#/# +
"I shall never be moved."

7 LORD, by your favor [.linebr]#/# +
you have made my mountain to stand strong. [.linebr]#/# +
You hid your face, [.linebr]#/# +
and I was troubled.

8 I cried to you, O LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
And to the LORD I made supplication.

9 What profit is there in my blood [.linebr]#/# +
when I go down to the pit? [.linebr]#/# +
Shall the dust praise you? [.linebr]#/# +
Shall it declare your truth?

10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me. [.linebr]#/# +
LORD, be my helper.

11 You have turned for me my mourning into dancing. [.linebr]#/# +
You have put off my sackcloth [.linebr]#/# +
and girded me with gladness,

12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to you and not be silent. [.linebr]#/# +
O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever.

1 [_To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David._]

In you, O LORD, I put my trust. [.linebr]#/# +
Let me never be ashamed. [.linebr]#/# +
Deliver me in your righteousness.

2 Bow down your ear to me. Deliver me speedily. [.linebr]#/# +
Be my strong rock, [.linebr]#/# +
a house of defense to save me.

3 For you are my rock and my fortress; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, for your name's sake lead me and guide me.

4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me, [.linebr]#/# +
for you are my strength.

[[psa031-005]]5 Into your hand I commit my spirit. [.linebr]#/# +
You have redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.

6 I have hated those who regard lying vanities, [.linebr]#/# +
but I trust in the LORD.

7 I will be glad and rejoice in your mercy, [.linebr]#/# +
for you have considered my trouble. [.linebr]#/# +
You have known my soul in adversities,

8 And have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. [.linebr]#/# +
You have set my foot in a large room.

9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble. [.linebr]#/# +
My eye is consumed with grief, even my soul and my belly.

10 For my life is spent with grief [.linebr]#/# +
and my years with sighing. [.linebr]#/# +
My strength fails because of my iniquity [.linebr]#/# +
and my bones are consumed.

11 I was a reproach among all my enemies, [.linebr]#/# +
but especially among my neighbors, [.linebr]#/# +
and a fear to my acquaintances. [.linebr]#/# +
Those who saw me outside fled from me.

12 I am forgotten like a dead man out of mind. [.linebr]#/# +
I am like a broken vessel.

13 For I have heard the slander of many. [.linebr]#/# +
Fear was on every side. [.linebr]#/# +
While they took counsel together against me, [.linebr]#/# +
they devised to take away my life.

14 But I trusted in you, O LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
I said, "You are my God."

15 My times are in your hand. [.linebr]#/# +
Deliver me from the hand of my enemies [.linebr]#/# +
and from those who persecute me.

16 Make your face to shine upon your servant. [.linebr]#/# +
Save me for your mercies' sake.

17 Do not let me be ashamed, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
for I have called upon you. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the wicked be ashamed. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them be silent in the grave.

18 Let the lying lips be put to silence, [.linebr]#/# +
which speak grievous things proudly [.linebr]#/# +
and contemptuously against the righteous.

19 Oh how great your goodness is, [.linebr]#/# +
which you have laid up for those who fear you, [.linebr]#/# +
which you have wrought for those who trust in you [.linebr]#/# +
before the sons of men!

20 You shall hide them in the secret of your presence [.linebr]#/# +
from the pride of man. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion [.linebr]#/# +
from the strife of tongues.

21 Blessed be the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
for he has shown me his wonderful kindness in a strong city.

22 For I said in my haste, [.linebr]#/# +
"I am cut off from before your eyes." [.linebr]#/# +
Nevertheless, you heard the voice of my supplications [.linebr]#/# +
when I cried to you.

23 O love the LORD, all his saints, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD preserves the faithful [.linebr]#/# +
and fully recompenses the proud doer.

24 Be of good courage, and he will strengthen your heart, [.linebr]#/# +
all you who hope in the LORD.

_The grievous estate of the wicked, 1-4. The excellency of God's mercy, 8, 9. David prays for favor to God's children, 10-12._

[[psa036-001]]1 [_To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the Servant of the LORD._]

The transgression of the wicked says within my heart [.linebr]#/# +
that there is no fear of God before his eyes.

2 For he flatters himself in his own eyes [.linebr]#/# +
until his iniquity is found to be hateful.

3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. [.linebr]#/# +
He has ceased to be wise and to do good.

4 He devises mischief upon his bed. [.linebr]#/# +
He sets himself in a way that is not good. [.linebr]#/# +
He does not abhor evil.

5 Your mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens [.linebr]#/# +
and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.

6 Your righteousness is like the great mountains. [.linebr]#/# +
Your judgments are a great deep. [.linebr]#/# +
O LORD, you preserve man and beast.

7 How excellent your loving-kindness is, O God! [.linebr]#/# +
Therefore, the children of men put their trust [.linebr]#/# +
under the shadow of your wings.

8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house, [.linebr]#/# +
and you shall make them drink from the river of your delights.

9 For with you is the fountain of life. [.linebr]#/# +
In your light we shall see light.

10 O continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, [.linebr]#/# +
and your righteousness to the upright in heart.

11 Do not let the foot of pride come against me, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not let the hand of the wicked drive me away.

12 There the workers of iniquity have fallen. [.linebr]#/# +
They are cast down and shall not be able to rise.

_David persuades to patience and confidence in God by the different estate of the godly and the wicked, 1-40._

1 [_A Psalm of David._]

Do not fret yourself because of evildoers, [.linebr]#/# +
neither be envious against the workers of iniquity.

2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass [.linebr]#/# +
and wither like the green herb.

3 Trust in the LORD and do good. [.linebr]#/# +
Dwell in the land, and truly you shall be fed.

4 Delight yourself also in the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and he will give you the desires of your heart.

5 Commit your way to the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.

6 And he will bring forth your righteousness like the light [.linebr]#/# +
and your judgment like the noon-day.

7 Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for him. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not fret yourself because of him who prospers in his way, [.linebr]#/# +
because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass.

8 Cease from anger and forsake wrath. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not fret yourself. It leads only to evil-doing.

9 For evildoers shall be cut off, [.linebr]#/# +
but those who wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall even diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

11 But the meek shall inherit the earth [.linebr]#/# +
and delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

12 The wicked plots against the just [.linebr]#/# +
and gnashes upon him with his teeth.

13 The Lord will laugh at him, [.linebr]#/# +
for he sees that his day is coming.

14 The wicked have drawn out the sword and bent their bow [.linebr]#/# +
to cast down the poor and needy [.linebr]#/# +
and to slay those who are of upright deportment.

15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, [.linebr]#/# +
and their bows shall be broken.

16 A little that a righteous man has is better [.linebr]#/# +
than the riches of many wicked.

17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, [.linebr]#/# +
but the LORD upholds the righteous.

18 The LORD knows the days of the upright, [.linebr]#/# +
and their inheritance shall be forever.

19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, [.linebr]#/# +
and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

20 But the wicked shall perish, [.linebr]#/# +
and the enemies of the LORD shall be like the fat of lambs. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall consume. Into smoke they shall consume away.

21 The wicked borrows and does not pay back, [.linebr]#/# +
but the righteous shows mercy and gives.

22 For those who are blessed by him shall inherit the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.

23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and he delights in his way.

24 Though he should fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, [.linebr]#/# +
for the LORD upholds him with his hand.

25 I have been young, and now am old, [.linebr]#/# +
yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, [.linebr]#/# +
nor his children begging for bread.

26 He is ever merciful and lends, [.linebr]#/# +
and his offspring is blessed.

27 Depart from evil and do good, [.linebr]#/# +
and dwell forevermore.

28 For the LORD loves judgment [.linebr]#/# +
and does not forsake his saints. [.linebr]#/# +
They are preserved forever, [.linebr]#/# +
but the offspring of the wicked shall be cut off.

29 The righteous shall inherit the land [.linebr]#/# +
and dwell therein forever.

30 The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, [.linebr]#/# +
and his tongue talks of judgment.

31 The law of his God is in his heart. [.linebr]#/# +
None of his steps shall slide.

32 The wicked watches the righteous [.linebr]#/# +
and seeks to slay him.

33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, [.linebr]#/# +
nor condemn him when he is judged.

34 Wait on the LORD and keep his way, [.linebr]#/# +
and he will exalt you to inherit the land. [.linebr]#/# +
When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.

35 I have seen the wicked in great power [.linebr]#/# +
and spreading himself like a green bay tree.

36 Yet he passed away, and behold, he was no more. [.linebr]#/# +
I even sought him, but he could not be found.

37 Mark the perfect man and behold the upright, [.linebr]#/# +
for the end of that man is peace.

38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together. [.linebr]#/# +
The end of the wicked shall be cut off.

39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
He is their strength in the time of trouble.

40 And the LORD will help them and deliver them. [.linebr]#/# +
He will deliver them from the wicked and save them [.linebr]#/# +
because they trust in him.

_David moves God to take compassion on his pitiful case, 1-22._

1 [_A Psalm of David: to bring to remembrance._]

O LORD, do not rebuke me in your wrath, [.linebr]#/# +
neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.

2 For your arrows stick firmly in me, [.linebr]#/# +
and your hand falls heavy upon me.

3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your anger, [.linebr]#/# +
neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

4 For my iniquities have gone over my head. [.linebr]#/# +
Like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.

5 My wounds are offensive and are corrupt [.linebr]#/# +
because of my foolishness.

6 I am troubled. I am bowed down greatly. [.linebr]#/# +
I go mourning all the day long.

7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease, [.linebr]#/# +
and there is no soundness in my flesh.

8 I am feeble and grievously broken. [.linebr]#/# +
I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.

9 Lord, all my desire is before you, [.linebr]#/# +
and my groaning is not hid from you.

10 My heart pants. My strength fails me. [.linebr]#/# +
As for the light of my eyes, that also is gone from me.

11 My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my affliction, [.linebr]#/# +
and my kinsmen stand afar off.

12 Those who also seek after my life lay snares for me. [.linebr]#/# +
And those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things [.linebr]#/# +
and plot deceits all the day long.

13 But I, like a deaf man, did not hear. [.linebr]#/# +
And I was like a mute man who does not open his mouth.

14 Thus I was like a man who does not hear, [.linebr]#/# +
and in whose mouth are no reproofs.

15 For in you, O LORD, I hope. [.linebr]#/# +
You will hear, O Lord my God.

16 For I said, "Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me. [.linebr]#/# +
When my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me."

17 For I am ready to fall, [.linebr]#/# +
and my sorrow is continually before me.

18 For I will declare my iniquity. [.linebr]#/# +
I will be sorry for my sin.

19 But my enemies are lively and they are strong, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

20 Those who also render evil for good [.linebr]#/# +
are my adversaries because I follow the thing that is good.

21 Do not forsake me, O LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
O my God, do not be far from me.

22 Make haste to help me, [.linebr]#/# +
O Lord my salvation.

_David's care of his thoughts, 1-3. The consideration of the brevity and vanity of life, 4-6; the reverence of God's judgments, 7-9, and prayer, are his bridles for impatience, 10-13._

1 [_To the Chief Musician, even to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David._]

I said, "I will take heed to my ways [.linebr]#/# +
so that I do not sin with my tongue. [.linebr]#/# +
I will keep my mouth with a bridle [.linebr]#/# +
while the wicked is before me."

2 I was mute with silence. [.linebr]#/# +
I held my peace, even from good, [.linebr]#/# +
and my sorrow was stirred.

3 My heart was hot within me. [.linebr]#/# +
While I was musing, the fire burned. [.linebr]#/# +
Then I spoke with my tongue:

4 "LORD, make me to know my end [.linebr]#/# +
and the measure of my days, what it is, [.linebr]#/# +
so that I may know how frail I am.

5 Behold, you have made my days as a hand-breadth, [.linebr]#/# +
and my age is as nothing before you. [.linebr]#/# +
Truly every man at his best state is altogether vanity." [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

6 "Surely every man walks in a vain show. [.linebr]#/# +
Surely they are disquieted in vain. [.linebr]#/# +
He heaps up riches and does not know who gathers them.

7 And now, Lord, what do I wait for? [.linebr]#/# +
My hope is in you.

8 Deliver me from all my transgressions. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not make me the reproach of the foolish.

9 I was mute. I did not open my mouth [.linebr]#/# +
because you did it.

10 Remove your stroke away from me. [.linebr]#/# +
I am consumed by the blow of your hand.

11 When you, with rebukes, correct man for iniquity, [.linebr]#/# +
you make his beauty to consume away like a moth. [.linebr]#/# +
Surely every man is vanity." [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

12 "Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not hold your peace at my tears, [.linebr]#/# +
for I am a stranger with you, [.linebr]#/# +
and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.

_The benefit of confidence in God, 1-5. Obedience is the best sacrifice, 6-10. The sense of David's evils inflames his prayer, 11-17._

1 [_To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David._]

I waited patiently for the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and he inclined to me and heard my cry.

2 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, [.linebr]#/# +
out of the miry clay, [.linebr]#/# +
and set my feet upon a rock [.linebr]#/# +
and established my goings.

3 And he has put a new song in my mouth, [.linebr]#/# +
even praise to our God. [.linebr]#/# +
Many shall see it and fear [.linebr]#/# +
and trust in the LORD.

4 Blessed is that man who makes the LORD his trust [.linebr]#/# +
and does not respect the proud [.linebr]#/# +
or those who turn aside to lies.

5 Many, O LORD, my God, [.linebr]#/# +
are your wonderful works which you have done [.linebr]#/# +
and your thoughts which are toward us. [.linebr]#/# +
They cannot be reckoned up in order to you. [.linebr]#/# +
If I would declare and speak of them, [.linebr]#/# +
they are more than can be numbered.

[[psa040-006]]6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire. [.linebr]#/# +
You have opened my ears. [.linebr]#/# +
Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required.

[[psa040-007]]7 Then I said, "Behold, I come. [.linebr]#/# +
In the volume of the book it is written about me.

[[psa040-008]]8 I delight to do your will, O my God. [.linebr]#/# +
Your law is even within my heart."

9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation. [.linebr]#/# +
Behold, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, as you know.

10 I have not hid your righteousness within my heart. [.linebr]#/# +
I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation. [.linebr]#/# +
I have not concealed your loving-kindness and your truth [.linebr]#/# +
from the great congregation.

11 Do not withhold your tender mercies from me, O LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Let your loving-kindness and your truth continually preserve me.

12 For innumerable evils have encompassed me. [.linebr]#/# +
My iniquities have taken hold upon me [.linebr]#/# +
so that I am not able to look up. [.linebr]#/# +
They are more than the hairs of my head; [.linebr]#/# +
therefore, my heart fails me.

13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me. [.linebr]#/# +
O LORD, make haste to help me.

14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together [.linebr]#/# +
who seek after my soul to destroy it. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them be driven backward and put to shame [.linebr]#/# +
who wish me evil.

15 Let them be desolate by reason of their shame [.linebr]#/# +
who say to me, "Aha, aha."

16 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. [.linebr]#/# +
Let those who love your salvation say continually, [.linebr]#/# +
"May the LORD be magnified."

17 But I am poor and needy, [.linebr]#/# +
yet the Lord thinks upon me. [.linebr]#/# +
You are my help and my deliverer. [.linebr]#/# +
Make no delay, O my God.

We have heard with our ears, O God. [.linebr]#/# +
Our fathers have told us what work you did in their days, [.linebr]#/# +

2 How you drove out the heathen with your hand [.linebr]#/# +

how you afflicted the people [.linebr]#/# +

3 For they did not obtain the land in possession by their own sword, [.linebr]#/# +
neither did their own arm save them, [.linebr]#/# +
but your right hand, your arm, [.linebr]#/# +
and the light of your countenance, [.linebr]#/# +
because you were favorable to them.

4 You are my King, O God. [.linebr]#/# +
Command deliverances for Jacob.

5 Through you we will push down our enemies. [.linebr]#/# +
Through your name we will tread them under who rise up against us.

6 For I will not trust in my bow, [.linebr]#/# +
neither shall my sword save me.

7 But you have saved us from our enemies [.linebr]#/# +

8 In God we boast all the day long. [.linebr]#/# +
We will praise your name forever. [.linebr]#/# +

9 But you have cast off and put us to shame [.linebr]#/# +
and do not go forth with our armies.

10 You make us to turn back from the enemy. [.linebr]#/# +
And those who hate us plunder for themselves.

11 You have given us like sheep appointed for food [.linebr]#/# +
and scattered us among the heathen.

12 You sell your people for nothing [.linebr]#/# +
and have not increased your wealth by their price.

13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors, [.linebr]#/# +
a scorn and a derision to those who are around us.

14 You make us a by-word among the heathen, [.linebr]#/# +
a shaking of the head among the people.

15 My disgrace is continually before me, [.linebr]#/# +
and the shame of my face has covered me,

16 Because of the voice of him who reproaches and blasphemes, [.linebr]#/# +
because of the enemy and avenger.

17 All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you, [.linebr]#/# +
neither have we dealt falsely in your covenant.

18 Our heart has not turned back, [.linebr]#/# +
neither have our steps declined from your way,

19 Though you have severely broken us in the place of jackals [.linebr]#/# +
and covered us with the shadow of death.

20 If we have forgotten the name of our God [.linebr]#/# +
or stretched out our hands to a strange god,

21 Will God not search this out? [.linebr]#/# +

_The confidence which the church has in God, 1-7. An exhortation to behold it, 8-11._

1 [_To the Chief Musician for the Sons of Korah. A Song upon Alamoth._]

God is our refuge and strength, [.linebr]#/# +
a very present help in trouble.

2 Therefore, we will not fear [.linebr]#/# +
though the earth is changed, [.linebr]#/# +
though the mountains are carried [.linebr]#/# +
into the midst of the sea,

3 Though its waters roar and are disturbed, [.linebr]#/# +
though the mountains shake with its swelling. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

4 There is a river, [.linebr]#/# +
the streams of which shall make the city of God glad, [.linebr]#/# +
the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.

5 God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved. [.linebr]#/# +
God shall help her at the turning of dawn.

6 The heathen raged. The kingdoms were moved. [.linebr]#/# +
He uttered his voice, and the earth melted.

7 The LORD of hosts is with us. [.linebr]#/# +
The God of Jacob is our refuge. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
what desolations he has made in the earth.

9 He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
He breaks the bow and cuts the spear apart. [.linebr]#/# +
He burns the chariot in the fire.

10 "Be still and know that I am God. [.linebr]#/# +
I will be exalted among the heathen. [.linebr]#/# +
I will be exalted in the earth."

11 The LORD of hosts is with us. [.linebr]#/# +
The God of Jacob is our refuge. [.linebr]#/# +

1 [_To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the Sons of Korah._]

O clap your hands, all you people. [.linebr]#/# +
Shout to God with the voice of triumph.

2 For the LORD most high is awesome. [.linebr]#/# +
He is a great King over all the earth.

3 He shall subdue the people under us [.linebr]#/# +
and the nations under our feet.

4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, [.linebr]#/# +
the excellence of Jacob whom he loved. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

5 God has gone up with a shout, [.linebr]#/# +
the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.

6 Sing praises to God, sing praises. [.linebr]#/# +
Sing praises to our King, sing praises.

7 For God is the King of all the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
Sing praises with understanding.

8 God reigns over the heathen. [.linebr]#/# +
God sits upon the throne of his holiness.

9 The princes of the people are assembled, [.linebr]#/# +

[[psa048-002]]2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, [.linebr]#/# +
is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, [.linebr]#/# +
the city of the great King.

3 God is known in her palaces as a refuge.

4 For behold, the kings were assembled. [.linebr]#/# +
They passed by together.

5 They saw it, and so they wondered. [.linebr]#/# +
They were troubled and hastened away.

6 Fear took hold upon them there, [.linebr]#/# +
and pain, as of a woman in travail.

7 You break the ships of Tarshish [.linebr]#/# +
with an east wind.

8 As we have heard, so we have seen [.linebr]#/# +
in the city of the LORD of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +
in the city of our God. [.linebr]#/# +
God will establish it forever. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

9 We have thought of your loving-kindness, O God, [.linebr]#/# +
in the midst of your temple.

10 According to your name, O God, [.linebr]#/# +
so is your praise to the ends of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
Your right hand is full of righteousness.

11 Let mount Zion rejoice, [.linebr]#/# +
let the daughters of Judah be glad [.linebr]#/# +
because of your judgments.

12 Walk around Zion and encompass her. [.linebr]#/# +
Number her towers,

13 Mark well her bulwarks, [.linebr]#/# +
and consider her palaces [.linebr]#/# +
so that you may tell it to the generation following.

14 For this God is our God forever and ever. [.linebr]#/# +
He will be our guide even to death.

_An earnest persuasion to build the faith of resurrection, not on worldly power, but on God, 1-15. Worldly prosperity is not to be admired, 16-20._

1 [_To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the Sons of Korah._]

Hear this, all you people. [.linebr]#/# +
Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world,

2 Both low and high, [.linebr]#/# +
rich and poor together.

3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom. [.linebr]#/# +
The meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

4 I will incline my ear to a parable. [.linebr]#/# +
I will open my dark saying upon the harp.

5 Why should I fear in the days of evil [.linebr]#/# +
when the iniquity of my heels encompasses me?

6 Those who trust in their wealth [.linebr]#/# +
and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches,

7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, [.linebr]#/# +
nor give to God a ransom for him

8 (For the redemption of their soul is costly, [.linebr]#/# +
and it ceases forever),

9 That he should still live forever [.linebr]#/# +
and not see corruption.

10 For he sees that wise men die; [.linebr]#/# +
likewise the fool and the brutish person perish [.linebr]#/# +
and leave their wealth to others.

11 Their inward thought is that their houses shall continue forever [.linebr]#/# +
and their dwelling places to all generations. [.linebr]#/# +
They call their lands after their own names.

12 Nevertheless, man being in honor does not abide. [.linebr]#/# +
He is like the beasts that perish.

13 Their way is their folly, [.linebr]#/# +
yet their posterity approve their sayings. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave. [.linebr]#/# +
Death shall feed on them. [.linebr]#/# +
The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning. [.linebr]#/# +
Their beauty shall consume [.linebr]#/# +
in the grave from their dwelling.

15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave, [.linebr]#/# +
for he shall receive me. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

16 Do not be afraid when one is made rich, [.linebr]#/# +
when the glory of his house is increased,

17 For when he dies he shall carry nothing away. [.linebr]#/# +
His glory shall not descend after him.

18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul— [.linebr]#/# +
and men will praise you when you do well to yourself—

19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall never see light.

20 A man who is in honor and does not understand [.linebr]#/# +

_The majesty of God in the church, 1-4. His order to gather his saints, 5, 6. The pleasure of God is not in ceremonies, 7-13, but in sincerity of obedience, 14-23._

1 [_A Psalm of Asaph._]

The mighty God, even the LORD, has spoken [.linebr]#/# +
and called the earth from the rising to the setting of the sun.

2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, [.linebr]#/# +
God has shined.

3 Our God shall come and shall not keep silence. [.linebr]#/# +
A fire shall devour before him [.linebr]#/# +
and it shall be very tempestuous around him.

4 He shall call to the heavens from above [.linebr]#/# +
and to the earth so that he may judge his people.

5 "Gather my saints together to me, [.linebr]#/# +
those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."

6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
for God is judge himself. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

7 "Hear, O my people, and I will speak, [.linebr]#/# +
O Israel, and I will testify against you. [.linebr]#/# +
I am God, even your God.

8 I will not reprove you for your sacrifices [.linebr]#/# +
or your burnt-offerings which have been continually before me.

9 I will take no bull out of your house, [.linebr]#/# +
nor male goats out of your folds.

10 For every beast of the forest is mine, [.linebr]#/# +
and the livestock upon a thousand hills.

11 I know all the birds of the mountains. [.linebr]#/# +
And the wild beasts of the field are mine.

12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, [.linebr]#/# +
for the world is mine, and the fullness thereof.

13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls [.linebr]#/# +
or drink the blood of goats?

14 Offer to God thanksgiving [.linebr]#/# +
and pay your vows to the Most High.

15 And call upon me in the day of trouble. [.linebr]#/# +
I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me."

16 But to the wicked, God says, [.linebr]#/# +
"What have you to do to declare my statutes, [.linebr]#/# +
or that you should take my covenant in your mouth,

17 Seeing you hate instruction [.linebr]#/# +
and cast my words behind you?

18 When you saw a thief, you consented with him. [.linebr]#/# +
You have been partaker with adulterers.

19 You give your mouth to evil [.linebr]#/# +
and your tongue frames deceit.

20 You sit and speak against your brother. [.linebr]#/# +
You slander your own mother's son.

21 These things you have done, and I kept silence. [.linebr]#/# +
You thought that I was altogether such a one as yourself. [.linebr]#/# +
But I will reprove you and set them in order before your eyes.

22 Now consider this, you who forget God, [.linebr]#/# +
lest I tear you in pieces and there be no one to deliver:

23 Whoever offers praise glorifies me, [.linebr]#/# +
and to him who orders his deportment aright [.linebr]#/# +
I will show the salvation of God."

According to the multitude of your tender mercies, [.linebr]#/# +
blot out my transgressions.

2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity [.linebr]#/# +

3 For I acknowledge my transgressions, [.linebr]#/# +

5 Behold, I was shaped in iniquity, [.linebr]#/# +

6 Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts. [.linebr]#/# +
And in the hidden part you shall make me to know wisdom.

7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean. [.linebr]#/# +
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

8 Make me to hear joy and gladness [.linebr]#/# +
so that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.

9 Hide your face from my sins [.linebr]#/# +
and blot out all my iniquities.

10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, [.linebr]#/# +
and renew a right spirit within me.

11 Do not cast me away from your presence, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.

12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation, [.linebr]#/# +
and uphold me with your free spirit.

13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, [.linebr]#/# +
and sinners shall be converted to you.

14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, [.linebr]#/# +
God of my salvation, [.linebr]#/# +
and my tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.

15 O Lord, open my lips, [.linebr]#/# +
and my mouth shall show forth your praise.

16 For you do not desire sacrifice, or else I would give it. [.linebr]#/# +
You do not delight in burnt-offering.

17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. [.linebr]#/# +
A broken and a contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

18 Do good in your good pleasure to Zion. [.linebr]#/# +
Build the walls of Jerusalem.

19 Then you shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
with burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering. [.linebr]#/# +
Then they shall offer bulls upon your altar.

_David prays to be delivered from his enemies, 1-5, whose desperate wickedness he describes, 6, 7. He trusts in God, 8-10. He prays against them, 11-15. He praises God, 16, 17._

1 [_To the Chief Musician. Al-taschith. Michtam of David: when Saul sent and they watched the house to kill him._]

Deliver me from my enemies, O my God. [.linebr]#/# +
Defend me from those who rise up against me.

2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity [.linebr]#/# +
and save me from bloody men.

3 For behold, they lie in wait for my soul. [.linebr]#/# +
The mighty are gathered against me, [.linebr]#/# +
not for my transgression nor for my sin, O LORD.

4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault. [.linebr]#/# +
Awake to help me, and behold.

5 You therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
awake to visit all the heathen. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not be merciful to any wicked transgressors. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

6 They return at evening. [.linebr]#/# +
They make a noise like a dog [.linebr]#/# +
and go throughout the city.

7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth. [.linebr]#/# +
Swords are in their lips, [.linebr]#/# +
for they say, "Who hears?"

8 But you, O LORD, shall laugh at them. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall have all the heathen in derision.

9 Because of his strength I will wait upon you, [.linebr]#/# +
for God is my defense.

10 As for my God, his mercy shall go before me. [.linebr]#/# +
God will let me see my desire upon my enemies.

11 Do not slay them, lest my people forget. [.linebr]#/# +
Scatter them by your power and bring them down, [.linebr]#/# +
O Lord our shield.

12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips, [.linebr]#/# +
let them even be taken in their pride, [.linebr]#/# +
and also for cursing and lying which they speak.

13 Consume them in wrath, [.linebr]#/# +
consume them, so that they may not be. [.linebr]#/# +
And let them know that God rules in Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
to the ends of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +

14 And at evening let them return. [.linebr]#/# +
And let them make a noise like a dog [.linebr]#/# +
and go throughout the city.

15 Let them wander up and down for food [.linebr]#/# +
and wait all night if they are not satisfied.

16 But I will sing of your power. [.linebr]#/# +
I will even sing aloud of your mercy in the morning, [.linebr]#/# +
for you have been my defense [.linebr]#/# +
and refuge in the day of my trouble.

17 To you, O my strength, I will sing, [.linebr]#/# +

1 [_To the Chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth. Michtam of David for Teaching: when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned and smote twelve thousand of Edom in the valley of salt._]

O God, you have cast us off. [.linebr]#/# +
You have scattered us. [.linebr]#/# +
You have been displeased. [.linebr]#/# +
O turn yourself to us again.

2 You have made the earth to tremble. [.linebr]#/# +
You have broken it. [.linebr]#/# +
Heal its breaches, for it shakes.

3 You have shown your people hard things. [.linebr]#/# +
You have made us to drink the wine of astonishment.

4 You have given a banner to those who fear you [.linebr]#/# +
so that it may be displayed because of the truth. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

5 So that your beloved may be delivered, [.linebr]#/# +
save with your right hand and hear me.

6 God has spoken in his holiness, "I will rejoice. [.linebr]#/# +
I will divide Shechem [.linebr]#/# +
and measure out the valley of Succoth.

7 Gilead is mine. And Manasseh is mine. [.linebr]#/# +
Ephraim also is the strength of my head. [.linebr]#/# +
Judah is my lawgiver.

8 Moab is my wash-pot. [.linebr]#/# +
Over Edom I will cast out my shoe. [.linebr]#/# +
Over Philistia I shout in triumph."

9 Who will bring me into the strong city? [.linebr]#/# +
Who will lead me into Edom?

10 Will you not, O God, who had cast us off, [.linebr]#/# +
and you, O God, who did not go out with our armies?

11 Give us help from trouble, [.linebr]#/# +
for the help of man is vain.

12 Through God we shall do valiantly, [.linebr]#/# +

Attend to my prayer.

2 From the end of the earth I will cry to you [.linebr]#/# +

Lead me to the rock that is higher than I am.

4 I will abide in your tabernacle forever. [.linebr]#/# +
I will trust in the covert of your wings. [.linebr]#/# +

You have given me the heritage [.linebr]#/# +

His years shall be like many generations.

7 He shall abide before God forever. [.linebr]#/# +

1 [_To the Chief Musician, to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David._]

Truly my soul waits upon God. [.linebr]#/# +
My salvation comes from him.

2 Only he is my rock and my salvation. [.linebr]#/# +
He is my defense. [.linebr]#/# +
I shall not be greatly moved.

3 How long will you devise mischief against a man? [.linebr]#/# +
All of you shall be slain. [.linebr]#/# +
You shall be like a bowing wall and like a tottering fence.

4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellence. [.linebr]#/# +
They delight in lies. [.linebr]#/# +
They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. [.linebr]#/# +

5 My soul, wait only upon God, [.linebr]#/# +
for my expectation is from him.

I shall not be moved.

7 In God is my salvation and my glory. [.linebr]#/# +

8 Trust in him at all times, you people. [.linebr]#/# +
Pour out your heart before him. [.linebr]#/# +
God is a refuge for us. [.linebr]#/# +

9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, [.linebr]#/# +

They are altogether lighter than vanity.

10 Do not trust in oppression, [.linebr]#/# +

If riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.

O God, you are my God. [.linebr]#/# +
Early I will seek you. [.linebr]#/# +
My soul thirsts for you. [.linebr]#/# +
My flesh longs for you [.linebr]#/# +

2 Thus I have seen you in the sanctuary, [.linebr]#/# +
seeing your power and your glory.

3 Because your loving-kindness is better than life, [.linebr]#/# +
my lips shall praise you.

4 Thus I will bless you while I live. [.linebr]#/# +
I will lift up my hands in your name.

5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, [.linebr]#/# +

7 Because you have been my help, [.linebr]#/# +
therefore in the shadow of your wings I will rejoice.

8 My soul follows hard after you. [.linebr]#/# +
Your right hand upholds me.

9 But those who seek my soul to destroy it [.linebr]#/# +

10 They shall fall by the sword. [.linebr]#/# +

Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer. [.linebr]#/# +
Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked, [.linebr]#/# +
from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity,

3 Who whet their tongue like a sword [.linebr]#/# +

4 So that they may shoot in secret at the perfect. [.linebr]#/# +
Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear.

They talk about laying snares secretly. [.linebr]#/# +
They say, "Who will see them?"

6 They search out iniquities. [.linebr]#/# +
They accomplish a diligent search. [.linebr]#/# +
Both the inward thought and the heart of every one of them is deep.

7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow. [.linebr]#/# +
Suddenly they shall be wounded.

You have laid affliction upon our loins.

27 There is the youngest, Benjamin, with their ruler, [.linebr]#/# +
the princes of Judah and their counsel, [.linebr]#/# +

Strengthen, O God, that which you have wrought for us.

29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
kings shall bring presents to you.

30 Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, [.linebr]#/# +
the multitude of the bulls with the calves of the people, [.linebr]#/# +
until each submits himself with pieces of silver. [.linebr]#/# +
Scatter the people who delight in war.

31 Princes shall come out of Egypt. [.linebr]#/# +
Cush shall soon stretch out her hands to God.

I have come into deep waters [.linebr]#/# +

34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, [.linebr]#/# +
the seas and everything that moves therein.

35 For God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah [.linebr]#/# +

And those who love his name shall dwell therein.

_David solicits God to the speedy destruction of the wicked and the preservation of the godly, 1-5._

1 [_To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David: to bring to remembrance._]

Make haste, O God, to deliver me. [.linebr]#/# +
Make haste to help me, O LORD.

2 Let them be ashamed and confounded [.linebr]#/# +
who seek after my soul. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them be turned backward and put to shame [.linebr]#/# +
who desire my hurt.

3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame [.linebr]#/# +
who say, "Aha, aha."

4 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. [.linebr]#/# +
And let those who love your salvation say continually, [.linebr]#/# +
"Let God be magnified."

5 But I am poor and needy. [.linebr]#/# +
Make haste to me, O God. [.linebr]#/# +
You are my help and my deliverer. [.linebr]#/# +
O LORD, make no delay.

_David, in confidence of faith and experience of God's favor, prays both for himself and against the enemies of his soul, 1-13. He promises constancy, 14-16. He prays for perseverance, 17, 18. He praises God and promises to do it cheerfully, 19-24._

1 In you, O LORD, I put my trust. [.linebr]#/# +
Let me never be put to shame.

2 Deliver me in your righteousness and cause me to escape. [.linebr]#/# +
Incline your ear to me and save me.

3 Be my strong habitation to which I may continually resort. [.linebr]#/# +
You have given commandment to save me, [.linebr]#/# +
for you are my rock and my fortress.

4 Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, [.linebr]#/# +
from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

5 For you are my hope, O Lord GOD. [.linebr]#/# +
You are my trust from my youth.

6 I have been sustained by you from my birth. [.linebr]#/# +
You are he who brought me into life. [.linebr]#/# +
My praise shall be continually of you.

7 I have become a wonder to many, [.linebr]#/# +
but you are my strong refuge.

8 Let my mouth be filled with your praise [.linebr]#/# +
and with your honor all the day.

9 Do not cast me off in the time of old age. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not forsake me when my strength fails.

10 For my enemies speak against me, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who lie in wait for my soul take counsel together,

11 Saying, "God has forsaken him. [.linebr]#/# +
Persecute and take him, for there is no one to deliver him."

12 O God, do not be far from me. [.linebr]#/# +
O my God, make haste for my help.

13 Let them be confounded and consumed [.linebr]#/# +
who are adversaries to my soul. [.linebr]#/# +
Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor [.linebr]#/# +
who seek my hurt.

14 But I will hope continually [.linebr]#/# +
and will praise you more and more.

15 My mouth shall show forth your righteousness [.linebr]#/# +
and your salvation all the day, [.linebr]#/# +
for I do not know the numbers thereof.

16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD. [.linebr]#/# +
I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours only.

17 O God, you have taught me from my youth, [.linebr]#/# +
and until now I have declared your wondrous works.

18 And even when I am old and gray-headed, [.linebr]#/# +
O God, do not forsake me, [.linebr]#/# +
until I have shown your strength to this generation [.linebr]#/# +
and your power to everyone who is to come.

19 Your righteousness also, O God, is very high, [.linebr]#/# +
who have done great things. O God, who is like you?

20 You, who have shown me great and severe troubles, [.linebr]#/# +
will revive me again [.linebr]#/# +
and bring me back from the depths of the earth.

21 You will increase my greatness [.linebr]#/# +
and comfort me on every side.

22 I will also praise you with the psaltery, [.linebr]#/# +
even your truth, O my God. [.linebr]#/# +
To you I will sing with the harp, [.linebr]#/# +
O Holy One of Israel.

23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing to you, [.linebr]#/# +
along with my soul which you have redeemed.

24 My tongue shall also talk [.linebr]#/# +
of your righteousness all the day long. [.linebr]#/# +
For they are confounded, [.linebr]#/# +

_David, praying for Solomon, shows the goodness and glory of his kingdom, and in type of Christ's kingdom, 1-17. He blesses God, 18-20._

1 [_A Psalm for Solomon._]

Give the king your judgments, O God, [.linebr]#/# +
and your righteousness to the king's son.

2 He shall judge your people with righteousness [.linebr]#/# +
and your poor with judgment.

3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, [.linebr]#/# +
and the little hills, by righteousness.

4 He shall judge the poor of the people. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall save the children of the needy [.linebr]#/# +
and break the oppressor in pieces.

5 They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon endure, [.linebr]#/# +
throughout all generations.

6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass, [.linebr]#/# +
like showers that water the earth.

7 In his days the righteous shall flourish, [.linebr]#/# +
and abundance of peace so long as the moon endures.

8 He shall also have dominion from sea to sea [.linebr]#/# +
and from the river to the ends of the earth.

9 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him, [.linebr]#/# +
and his enemies shall lick the dust.

10 The kings of Tarshish and of the islands shall bring presents. [.linebr]#/# +
The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

11 Indeed, all kings shall fall down before him. [.linebr]#/# +
All nations shall serve him.

12 For he shall deliver the needy when he cries, [.linebr]#/# +
and also the poor and him who has no helper.

13 He shall spare the poor and needy [.linebr]#/# +
and save the souls of the needy.

14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence, [.linebr]#/# +
and precious shall be their blood in his sight.

15 And he shall live, and to him the gold of Sheba shall be given. [.linebr]#/# +
Prayer shall also be made for him continually, [.linebr]#/# +
and daily he shall be praised.

16 There shall be a handful of grain in the earth [.linebr]#/# +
upon the top of the mountains. [.linebr]#/# +
Its fruit shall shake like Lebanon. [.linebr]#/# +
And those of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

17 His name shall endure forever. [.linebr]#/# +
His name shall be continued as long as the sun. [.linebr]#/# +
And men shall be blessed in him. [.linebr]#/# +
All nations shall call him blessed.

18 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
who only does wondrous things.

19 And blessed be his glorious name forever. [.linebr]#/# +
And let the whole earth be filled with his glory. [.linebr]#/# +

_The prophet, prevailing in a temptation, 1, shows the occasion thereof, the prosperity of the wicked, 2-12; the wound given thereby, diffidence, 13, 14; the victory over it, and knowledge of God's purpose in destroying the wicked and sustaining the righteous, 15-28._

1 [_A Psalm of Asaph._]

Truly God is good to Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
even to those who are of a clean heart.

2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone. [.linebr]#/# +
My steps had well near slipped.

3 For I was envious at the foolish [.linebr]#/# +
when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

4 For there are no pangs in their death, [.linebr]#/# +
but their strength is firm.

5 They are not in trouble like other men, [.linebr]#/# +
neither are they afflicted like other men.

6 Therefore, pride encompasses them like a chain. [.linebr]#/# +
Violence covers them like a garment.

7 Their eyes stand out with fatness. [.linebr]#/# +
The imaginations of their heart transgressed.

8 They are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression. [.linebr]#/# +
They speak loftily.

9 They set their mouth against the heavens [.linebr]#/# +
and their tongue walks through the earth.

10 Therefore, his people return here. [.linebr]#/# +
And waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.

11 And they say, "How does God know? [.linebr]#/# +
And is there knowledge in the Most High?"

12 Behold, these are the ungodly [.linebr]#/# +
who prosper in the world. They increase in riches.

13 Truly I have cleansed my heart in vain [.linebr]#/# +
and washed my hands in innocence.

14 For all the day long I have been afflicted [.linebr]#/# +
and chastened every morning.

15 If I had said, "I will speak thus," [.linebr]#/# +
behold, I would have offended against the generation of your children.

16 When I thought to know this, [.linebr]#/# +
it was too painful for me,

17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God. [.linebr]#/# +
Then I understood their end.

18 Surely you set them in slippery places. [.linebr]#/# +
You cast them down into destruction.

19 How they are brought into desolation in a moment! [.linebr]#/# +
They are utterly consumed with terrors.

20 As a dream when one awakes, [.linebr]#/# +
so, O Lord, when you awake, you will despise their image.

21 Thus my soul was grieved [.linebr]#/# +
and I was pricked in my heart.

22 So foolish was I, and ignorant. [.linebr]#/# +
I was like a beast before you.

23 Nevertheless, I am continually with you. [.linebr]#/# +
You have held me by my right hand.

24 You will guide me with your counsel, [.linebr]#/# +
and afterward, receive me to glory.

25 Whom do I have in heaven but you? [.linebr]#/# +
And there is no one upon earth that I desire besides you.

26 My flesh and my heart fails, [.linebr]#/# +
but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

27 For behold, those who are far from you shall perish. [.linebr]#/# +
You have destroyed all those who go astray from you.

28 But it is good for me to draw near to God. [.linebr]#/# +
I have put my trust in the Lord GOD [.linebr]#/# +
so that I may declare all your works.

_The prophet bemoans the desolation of the sanctuary, 1-9. He moves God to help in consideration of his power, 10-17; of his reproachful enemies, of his children, and of his covenant, 18-23._

1 [_Maschil of Asaph._]

O God, why have you cast us off forever? [.linebr]#/# +
Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?

2 Remember your congregation which you have purchased of old, [.linebr]#/# +
the rod of your inheritance which you have redeemed, [.linebr]#/# +
this mount Zion in which you have dwelt.

3 Lift up your feet to the perpetual desolations, [.linebr]#/# +
even all that the enemy has done wickedly in the sanctuary.

4 Your enemies roar in the midst of your congregations. [.linebr]#/# +
They set up their ensigns for signs.

5 They seemed like men who lifted up axes [.linebr]#/# +
upon the thick trees.

6 But now they break down its carved work [.linebr]#/# +
at once with axes and hammers.

7 They have cast fire into your sanctuary. [.linebr]#/# +
They have defiled by casting down [.linebr]#/# +
the dwelling-place of your name to the ground.

8 They said in their hearts, "Let us destroy them together." [.linebr]#/# +
They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

9 We do not see our signs. [.linebr]#/# +
There is no longer any prophet, [.linebr]#/# +
neither is there among us any who knows how long.

10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? [.linebr]#/# +
Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?

11 Why do you withdraw your hand, [.linebr]#/# +
even your right hand? Pluck it out of your bosom.

12 For God is my King of old, [.linebr]#/# +
working salvation in the midst of the earth.

13 You divided the sea by your strength. [.linebr]#/# +
You broke the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.

14 You broke the head of leviathan in pieces [.linebr]#/# +
and gave him to be food for the people inhabiting the wilderness.

15 You cleaved the fountain and the flood. [.linebr]#/# +
You dried up mighty rivers.

16 The day is yours, the night also is yours. [.linebr]#/# +
You have prepared the light and the sun.

17 You have set all the borders of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
You have made summer and winter.

18 Remember this: the enemy has reproached, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and the foolish people have blasphemed your name.

19 O do not deliver the soul of your turtle-dove to the multitude of the wicked. [.linebr]#/# +
Do not forget the congregation of your poor forever.

20 Have respect to the covenant, [.linebr]#/# +
for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

21 O do not let the oppressed return ashamed. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the poor and needy praise your name.

22 Arise, O God, plead your own cause. [.linebr]#/# +
Remember how the foolish man reproaches you daily.

23 Do not forget the voice of your enemies. [.linebr]#/# +
The tumult of those who rise against you increases continually.

7 Will the Lord cast off forever? [.linebr]#/# +

1 [_Maschil of Asaph._]

Give ear, O my people, to my law. [.linebr]#/# +
Incline your ear to the words of my mouth.

[[psa078-002]]2 I will open my mouth in a parable. [.linebr]#/# +
I will utter dark sayings of old,

3 Which we have heard and known [.linebr]#/# +
and our fathers have told us.

4 We will not hide them from their children, [.linebr]#/# +
showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
his strength, and his wonderful works that he has done.

5 For he established a testimony in Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
and appointed a law in Israel, [.linebr]#/# +
which he commanded our fathers, [.linebr]#/# +
that they should make them known to their children,

6 So that the generation to come might know them, [.linebr]#/# +
even the children who should be born, [.linebr]#/# +
who should arise and declare them to their children;

7 So that they might set their hope in God [.linebr]#/# +
and not forget the works of God, [.linebr]#/# +
but keep his commandments,

8 And might not be as their fathers, [.linebr]#/# +
a stubborn and rebellious generation, [.linebr]#/# +
a generation that did not set their heart aright [.linebr]#/# +
and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.

9 The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, [.linebr]#/# +
turned back in the day of battle.

10 They did not keep the covenant of God [.linebr]#/# +
and refused to walk in his law,

11 And forgot his works [.linebr]#/# +
and his wonders that he had shown them.

12 He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, [.linebr]#/# +
in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

13 He divided the sea and caused them to pass through. [.linebr]#/# +
He made the waters to stand like a heap.

14 In the day-time he also led them with a cloud, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the night with a light of fire.

15 He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness [.linebr]#/# +
and gave them drink as abundant as the depths.

16 He also brought streams out of the rock [.linebr]#/# +
and caused waters to run down like rivers.

17 Yet they still went on to sin against him [.linebr]#/# +
by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.

18 And they tested God in their heart [.linebr]#/# +
by asking food for their desire.

19 They even spoke against God. [.linebr]#/# +
They said, "Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?

20 Behold, he smote the rock so that the waters gushed out [.linebr]#/# +
and the streams overflowed. [.linebr]#/# +
Can he give bread also? [.linebr]#/# +
Can he provide flesh for his people?"

21 Therefore, the LORD heard this and was angry. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus a fire was kindled against Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
and anger also came up against Israel,

22 Because they did not believe in God [.linebr]#/# +
and did not trust in his salvation,

23 Though he commanded the clouds from above [.linebr]#/# +
and opened the doors of heaven,

[[psa078-024]]24 And rained down manna upon them to eat [.linebr]#/# +
and gave them the grain of heaven.

25 Man ate angels' food. [.linebr]#/# +
He sent them food to the full.

26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven. [.linebr]#/# +
And by his power he brought in the south wind.

27 He also rained flesh upon them like dust, [.linebr]#/# +
and feathered birds like the sand of the sea.

28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp [.linebr]#/# +
around their habitations.

29 So they ate and were well filled, [.linebr]#/# +
for he gave them their own desire.

30 They were not estranged from their desire. [.linebr]#/# +
But while their food was still in their mouths,

31 The wrath of God came upon them [.linebr]#/# +
and slew the fattest of them [.linebr]#/# +
and smote down the chosen men of Israel.

32 For all this they sinned still [.linebr]#/# +
and did not believe in his wondrous works.

33 Therefore, he consumed their days in vanity [.linebr]#/# +
and their years in trouble.

34 When he slew them, they sought him. [.linebr]#/# +
They returned and inquired early after God.

35 And they remembered that God was their rock [.linebr]#/# +
and the high God their redeemer.

36 Nevertheless, they flattered him with their mouth [.linebr]#/# +
and they lied to him with their tongues.

37 For their heart was not right with him, [.linebr]#/# +
neither were they steadfast in his covenant.

38 But he, being full of compassion, [.linebr]#/# +
forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. [.linebr]#/# +
Many a time he even turned his anger away [.linebr]#/# +
and did not stir up all his wrath.

39 For he remembered that they were only flesh, [.linebr]#/# +
a wind that passes away and does not return.

40 How often they provoked him in the wilderness [.linebr]#/# +
and grieved him in the desert!

41 They even turned back and tested God [.linebr]#/# +
and limited the Holy One of Israel.

42 They did not remember his hand, [.linebr]#/# +
nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy,

43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt [.linebr]#/# +
and his wonders in the field of Zoan,

44 And had turned their rivers into blood, [.linebr]#/# +
and also their floods, so that they could not drink.

45 He sent swarms of flies among them which devoured them, [.linebr]#/# +
and also frogs which destroyed them.

46 He also gave their increase to the ravaging-locust [.linebr]#/# +
and their labor to the swarming-locust.

47 He destroyed their vines with hail [.linebr]#/# +
and their sycamore trees with frost.

48 He also gave up their livestock to the hail [.linebr]#/# +
and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, [.linebr]#/# +
wrath, indignation, and trouble, [.linebr]#/# +
by sending evil angels among them.

50 He made a way to his anger. [.linebr]#/# +
He did not spare their soul from death, [.linebr]#/# +
but gave their life over to the pestilence,

51 And smote all the first-born in Egypt, [.linebr]#/# +
the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham,

52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep [.linebr]#/# +
and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

53 And he led them on safely so that they did not fear. [.linebr]#/# +
But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, [.linebr]#/# +
even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

55 He also cast out the heathen before them. [.linebr]#/# +
He divided them an inheritance by line [.linebr]#/# +
and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

56 Yet they tested and provoked the most high God [.linebr]#/# +
and did not keep his testimonies,

57 But turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers. [.linebr]#/# +
They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places [.linebr]#/# +
and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.

59 When God heard this, he was angry [.linebr]#/# +
and greatly abhorred Israel,

60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, [.linebr]#/# +
the tent which he placed among men,

61 And delivered his strength into captivity [.linebr]#/# +
and his glory into the enemy's hand.

62 He also gave over his people to the sword [.linebr]#/# +
and was angry with his inheritance.

63 The fire consumed their young men, [.linebr]#/# +
and their young women were not given to marriage.

64 Their priests fell by the sword, [.linebr]#/# +
and their widows made no lamentation.

65 Then the Lord awoke like someone out of sleep [.linebr]#/# +
and like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.

66 And he smote his enemies backward. [.linebr]#/# +
He put them to a perpetual reproach.

67 Moreover, he refused the tabernacle of Joseph [.linebr]#/# +
and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,

68 But chose the tribe of Judah, [.linebr]#/# +
the mount Zion which he loved.

69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, [.linebr]#/# +
like the earth which he has established forever.

70 He also chose David his servant [.linebr]#/# +
and took him from the sheep-folds.

71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him [.linebr]#/# +
to feed Jacob his people and Israel his inheritance.

72 Thus he fed them according to the integrity of his heart [.linebr]#/# +
and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

_The psalmist bemoans the desolation of Jerusalem, 1-7. He prays for deliverance, 8-12; and promises thankfulness, 13._

1 [_A Psalm of Asaph._]

O God, the heathen have come into your inheritance. [.linebr]#/# +
They have defiled your holy temple. [.linebr]#/# +
They have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants [.linebr]#/# +
to be food for the birds of the heaven, [.linebr]#/# +
the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.

3 They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem, [.linebr]#/# +
and there was no one to bury them.

4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, [.linebr]#/# +
a scorn and derision to those who are around us.

5 How long, LORD? Will you be angry forever? [.linebr]#/# +
Shall your jealousy burn like fire?

6 Pour out your wrath upon the heathen [.linebr]#/# +
who have not known you [.linebr]#/# +
and upon the kingdoms [.linebr]#/# +
that have not called upon your name.

7 For they have devoured Jacob [.linebr]#/# +
and laid waste his dwelling-place.

8 O do not hold former iniquities against us. [.linebr]#/# +
Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, [.linebr]#/# +
for we are brought very low.

9 Help us, O God of our salvation, [.linebr]#/# +
for the glory of your name, [.linebr]#/# +
and deliver us and purge away our sins [.linebr]#/# +
for your name's sake.

10 Why should the heathen say, "Where is their God?" [.linebr]#/# +
Let him be known among the heathen in our sight [.linebr]#/# +
by avenging the blood of your servants which is shed.

11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. [.linebr]#/# +
According to the greatness of your power [.linebr]#/# +
preserve those who are appointed to die.

12 And render to our neighbors seven-fold into their bosom [.linebr]#/# +
their reproach with which they have reproached you, O Lord.

13 So we your people and sheep of your pasture [.linebr]#/# +
will give you thanks forever. [.linebr]#/# +
We will show forth your praise to all generations.

You who dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.

2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, [.linebr]#/# +

4 O LORD God of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +

5 You feed them with the bread of tears [.linebr]#/# +

7 Turn us back, O God of hosts, [.linebr]#/# +

8 You have brought a vine out of Egypt. [.linebr]#/# +
You have cast out the heathen and planted it.

9 You cleared a place before it, [.linebr]#/# +
and it took deep root and filled the land.

10 The hills were covered with its shade, [.linebr]#/# +
and its boughs were like the beautiful cedars.

11 She sent out her boughs to the sea [.linebr]#/# +

12 Why have you then broken down her hedges [.linebr]#/# +
so that all those who pass by the way pluck her?

13 The boar from the forest wastes it, [.linebr]#/# +
and the wild beast of the field devours it.

14 Return, we implore you, O God of hosts. [.linebr]#/# +
Look down from heaven and behold. Visit this vine,

15 The vineyard which your right hand planted, [.linebr]#/# +
the branch that you made strong for yourself.

16 It is burnt with fire. It is cut down. [.linebr]#/# +
They perish at the rebuke of your countenance.

17 Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, [.linebr]#/# +
upon the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.

18 Then we will not go back from you. [.linebr]#/# +
Revive us, and we will call upon your name.

2 Take a psalm and bring here the tambourine, [.linebr]#/# +

3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon, [.linebr]#/# +

4 For this was a statute for Israel [.linebr]#/# +

5 He ordained this in Joseph for a testimony [.linebr]#/# +

I heard a language that I did not understand:

neither shall you worship any strange god.

10 I am the LORD your God [.linebr]#/# +
who brought you out of the land of Egypt. [.linebr]#/# +
Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

11 But my people would not listen to my voice, [.linebr]#/# +
and Israel would not obey me.

12 So I gave them up to the lust of their hearts, [.linebr]#/# +
and they walked in their own counsels.

13 O that my people had listened to me [.linebr]#/# +
and Israel had walked in my ways!

14 I would soon subdue their enemies [.linebr]#/# +
and turn my hand against their adversaries.

15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves to him, [.linebr]#/# +

I will not lie to David.

36 His offspring shall endure forever, [.linebr]#/# +
and his throne as the sun before me.

37 It shall be established forever like the moon, [.linebr]#/# +
like the faithful witness in the sky." [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

38 But you have cast off and abhorred, [.linebr]#/# +
you have been angry with your anointed.

39 You have made the covenant of your servant void. [.linebr]#/# +
You have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

40 You have broken all his hedges down. [.linebr]#/# +
You have brought his strongholds to ruin.

41 All who pass by the way plunder him. [.linebr]#/# +
He is a reproach to his neighbors.

42 You have set up the right hand of his adversaries. [.linebr]#/# +
You have made all his enemies to rejoice.

43 You have also turned the edge of his sword [.linebr]#/# +
and have not made him to stand in the battle.

44 You have made his glory to cease [.linebr]#/# +
and cast his throne down to the ground.

45 The days of his youth you have shortened. [.linebr]#/# +
You have covered him with shame. [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

46 How long, LORD, will you hide yourself? [.linebr]#/# +
Forever? Shall your wrath burn like fire?

47 Remember how short my time is. [.linebr]#/# +
Why have you made all men in vain?

48 What man is he who lives and shall not see death? [.linebr]#/# +
Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? [.linebr]#/# +
+[+ _Selah._ +]+

49 Lord, where are your former loving-kindnesses [.linebr]#/# +
which you swore to David in your truth?

50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants, [.linebr]#/# +
how I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people,

51 With which your enemies have reproached, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
with which they have reproached the footsteps of your anointed.

52 Blessed be the LORD forevermore. [.linebr]#/# +
Amen and amen.

_Moses sets forth God's providence, 1, 2. The frailty of the state of man, 3-9, and brevity of life, 10, 11. He prays for the knowledge and sensible experience of God's good providence, 12-17._

1 [_A Prayer of Moses the Man of God._]

Lord, you have been our dwelling-place [.linebr]#/# +
in all generations.

2 Before the mountains were brought forth, [.linebr]#/# +
or before you had formed the earth and the world, [.linebr]#/# +
even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.

3 You turn man to destruction [.linebr]#/# +
and say, "Return, you children of men."

4 For a thousand years in your sight [.linebr]#/# +
are like yesterday when it is past [.linebr]#/# +
and like a watch in the night.

5 You carry them away as with a flood. They are like a dream. [.linebr]#/# +
In the morning they are like grass which grows.

6 In the morning it flourishes and grows. [.linebr]#/# +
In the evening it is cut down and withers.

7 For we are consumed by your anger, [.linebr]#/# +
and by your wrath we are troubled.

8 You have set our iniquities before you, [.linebr]#/# +
our secret sins in the light of your countenance.

9 For all our days are passed away in your wrath. [.linebr]#/# +
We spend our years as a tale that is told.

10 The days of our years are seventy years. [.linebr]#/# +
And if by reason of strength they are eighty years, [.linebr]#/# +
yet their strength is labor and sorrow, [.linebr]#/# +
for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

11 Who knows the power of your anger? [.linebr]#/# +
Even according to your fear, so is your wrath.

12 So teach us to number our days [.linebr]#/# +
so that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.

13 Return, O LORD, how long? [.linebr]#/# +
And repent concerning your servants.

14 O satisfy us early with your mercy [.linebr]#/# +
so that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

15 Make us glad according to the days in which you have afflicted us [.linebr]#/# +
and the years in which we have seen evil.

16 Let your work appear to your servants [.linebr]#/# +
and your glory to their children.

17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us. [.linebr]#/# +
And establish the work of our hands upon us. [.linebr]#/# +
Yes, the work of our hands, establish it.

8 Only with your eyes you shall behold [.linebr]#/# +

You have made the Most High your habitation.

1 [_A Psalm or Song for the Sabbath Day._]

It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and to sing praises to your name, O Most High,

2 To show forth your loving-kindness in the morning [.linebr]#/# +
and your faithfulness every night,

3 Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery, [.linebr]#/# +
upon the harp with a solemn sound.

4 For you, LORD, have made me glad through your work. [.linebr]#/# +
I will triumph in the works of your hands.

5 O LORD, how great your works are! [.linebr]#/# +
And your thoughts are very deep.

6 A brutish man does not know, [.linebr]#/# +
neither does a fool understand this.

7 When the wicked spring like the grass [.linebr]#/# +
and when all the workers of iniquity flourish, [.linebr]#/# +
it is that they shall be destroyed forever.

8 But you, LORD, are most high forevermore.

9 For behold, your enemies, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
for behold, your enemies shall perish. [.linebr]#/# +
All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

10 But you shall exalt my horn like the horn of a wild ox. [.linebr]#/# +
I shall be anointed with fresh oil.

11 My eye has also seen my enemies, [.linebr]#/# +
and my ears shall hear the wicked [.linebr]#/# +
who rise up against me.

12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree. [.linebr]#/# +
He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

13 Those who are planted in the house of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
shall flourish in the courts of our God.

14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age. [.linebr]#/# +
They shall be fat and flourishing,

15 To show that the LORD is upright. [.linebr]#/# +
He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

1 O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongs, [.linebr]#/# +
O God, to whom vengeance belongs, show yourself.

2 Lift up yourself, judge of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
Render a reward to the proud.

3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, [.linebr]#/# +
how long shall the wicked triumph?

4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?

5 They break your people in pieces, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and afflict your heritage.

6 They slay the widow and the stranger [.linebr]#/# +
and murder the fatherless.

7 Yet they say, "The LORD will not see, [.linebr]#/# +
neither will the God of Jacob regard it."

8 Understand, you brutish among the people. [.linebr]#/# +
And you fools, when will you be wise?

9 He who planted the ear, shall he not hear? [.linebr]#/# +
He who formed the eye, shall he not see?

10 He who chastises the heathen, shall he not correct? [.linebr]#/# +
He who teaches man knowledge, shall he not know?

[[psa094-011]]11 The LORD knows the thoughts of man, [.linebr]#/# +
that they are vanity.

12 Blessed is the man whom you chasten, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and teach him out of your law,

13 So that you may give him rest from the days of adversity [.linebr]#/# +
until the pit is dug for the wicked.

[[psa094-014]]14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, [.linebr]#/# +
neither will he forsake his inheritance.

15 But judgment shall return to righteousness, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the upright in heart shall follow it.

16 Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? [.linebr]#/# +
Or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

17 Unless the LORD had been my help, [.linebr]#/# +
my soul would have almost dwelt in silence.

18 When I said, "My foot slips," [.linebr]#/# +
your mercy, O LORD, held me up.

19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me, [.linebr]#/# +
your comforts delight my soul.

20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with you, [.linebr]#/# +
which frames mischief by a law?

21 They assemble themselves against the soul of the righteous [.linebr]#/# +
and condemn the innocent blood.

22 But the LORD is my defense, [.linebr]#/# +
and my God is the rock of my refuge.

23 And he will bring upon them their own iniquity [.linebr]#/# +
and will cut them off in their own wickedness. [.linebr]#/# +
Indeed, the LORD our God will cut them off.

Hear my prayer, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +

2 Do not hide your face from me [.linebr]#/# +

Incline your ear to me. [.linebr]#/# +
In the day when I call, answer me speedily.

my bones cleave to my skin.

6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness. [.linebr]#/# +

8 My enemies reproach me all the day, [.linebr]#/# +

For you have lifted me up and cast me down.

Indeed, all of them shall grow old like a garment. [.linebr]#/# +
Like a vesture you will change them, [.linebr]#/# +

=== Psalm 103

[.outline.text-center]
_An exhortation to bless God for his mercy, 1-14, and for the constancy thereof, 15-22._

1 [_A Psalm of David._]

Bless the LORD, O my soul. [.linebr]#/# +
And all that is within me, bless his holy name.

2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not forget all his benefits.

3 It is he who forgives all your iniquities, [.linebr]#/# +
who heals all your diseases,

4 Who redeems your life from destruction, [.linebr]#/# +
who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercies,

5 Who satisfies your mouth with good things [.linebr]#/# +
so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.

6 The LORD executes righteousness [.linebr]#/# +
and judgment for all who are oppressed.

7 He made his ways known to Moses, [.linebr]#/# +
his acts to the children of Israel.

8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, [.linebr]#/# +
slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.

9 He will not always chide, [.linebr]#/# +
neither will he keep his anger forever.

10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins [.linebr]#/# +
or rewarded us according to our iniquities.

11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
so is his mercy great toward those who fear him.

12 As far as the east is from the west, [.linebr]#/# +
so far has he removed our transgressions from us.

13 As a father pities his children, [.linebr]#/# +
so the LORD pities those who fear him.

14 For he knows our frame. [.linebr]#/# +
He remembers that we are dust.

15 As for man, his days are like grass. [.linebr]#/# +
As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.

16 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone, [.linebr]#/# +
and its place shall know it no more.

[[psa103-017]]17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting [.linebr]#/# +
upon those who fear him, [.linebr]#/# +
and his righteousness to children's children,

18 To those who keep his covenant, [.linebr]#/# +
and to those who remember his commandments to do them.

19 The LORD has prepared his throne in the heavens, [.linebr]#/# +
and his kingdom rules over all.

20 Bless the LORD, you angels of his, [.linebr]#/# +
who excel in strength, who do his commandments, [.linebr]#/# +
listening to the voice of his word.

21 Bless the LORD, all you hosts of his, [.linebr]#/# +
you ministers of his, who do his pleasure.

22 Bless the LORD, all his works [.linebr]#/# +
in all places of his dominion. [.linebr]#/# +
Bless the LORD, O my soul.

_A meditation upon the mighty power, 1-6, and wonderful providence of God, 7-30. God's glory is eternal, 31, 32. The prophet vows perpetually to praise God, 33-35._

1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. [.linebr]#/# +
O LORD my God, you are very great. [.linebr]#/# +
You are clothed with honor and majesty,

2 Who covers himself with light as with a garment, [.linebr]#/# +
who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,

3 Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters, [.linebr]#/# +
who makes the clouds his chariot, [.linebr]#/# +
who walks upon the wings of the wind,

[[psa104-004]]4 Who makes his angels spirits, [.linebr]#/# +
his ministers a flaming fire,

5 Who laid the foundations of the earth [.linebr]#/# +
so that it should not be moved forever.

6 You covered it with the deep as with a garment. [.linebr]#/# +
The waters stood above the mountains.

7 At your rebuke they fled. [.linebr]#/# +
At the voice of your thunder they hastened away.

8 They go up by the mountains. They go down by the valleys [.linebr]#/# +
to the place which you have founded for them.

9 You have set a bound that they may not pass over [.linebr]#/# +
so that they do not turn back to cover the earth.

10 He sends the springs into the valleys, [.linebr]#/# +
which run among the hills.

11 They give drink to every beast of the field. [.linebr]#/# +
The wild donkeys quench their thirst.

12 By them the birds of the heaven shall have their habitation, [.linebr]#/# +
which sing among the branches.

13 He waters the hills from his chambers. [.linebr]#/# +
The earth is satisfied with the fruit of your works.

14 He causes the grass to grow for the livestock [.linebr]#/# +
and the herb for the service of man [.linebr]#/# +
so that he may bring forth food out of the earth:

15 Wine that rejoices the heart of man, [.linebr]#/# +
oil to cause his face to shine, [.linebr]#/# +
and bread which strengthens man's heart.

16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap, [.linebr]#/# +
the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted.

17 There the birds make their nests. [.linebr]#/# +
As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.

18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, [.linebr]#/# +
and the rocks for the conies.

19 He appoints the moon for seasons. [.linebr]#/# +
The sun knows his going down.

20 You make darkness, and it is night, [.linebr]#/# +
in which all the beasts of the forest creep forth.

21 The young lions roar after their prey [.linebr]#/# +
and seek their food from God.

22 The sun arises, and they collect [.linebr]#/# +
and lay themselves down in their dens.

23 Man goes forth to his work [.linebr]#/# +
and to his labor until the evening.

24 O LORD, how manifold your works are! [.linebr]#/# +
In wisdom you have made them all. [.linebr]#/# +
The earth is full of your riches.

25 Thus is this great and wide sea [.linebr]#/# +
in which are moving things innumerable, [.linebr]#/# +
both small and great beasts.

26 There go the ships. [.linebr]#/# +
There is that leviathan which you have made to play therein.

27 These all wait upon you [.linebr]#/# +
so that you may give them their food in due season.

28 That which you give them, they gather. [.linebr]#/# +
You open your hand, and they are filled with good.

29 You hide your face, and they are troubled. [.linebr]#/# +
You take away their breath, and they die [.linebr]#/# +
and return to their dust.

30 You send forth your Spirit, and they are created. [.linebr]#/# +
And you renew the face of the earth.

31 The glory of the LORD shall endure forever. [.linebr]#/# +
The LORD shall rejoice in his works.

32 He looks at the earth, and it trembles. [.linebr]#/# +
He touches the hills, and they smoke.

33 I will sing to the LORD as long as I live. [.linebr]#/# +
I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

34 My meditation of him shall be sweet. [.linebr]#/# +
I will be glad in the LORD.

35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
and let the wicked be no more. [.linebr]#/# +
Bless the LORD, O my soul. [.linebr]#/# +
Praise the LORD.

_An exhortation to praise God and to seek out his works, 1-6. The story of God's providence over Abraham, 7-15; over Joseph, 16-22; over Jacob in Egypt, 23-25; over Moses delivering the Israelites, 26-36; over the Israelites brought out of Egypt, fed in the wilderness, and planted in Canaan, 37-45._

1 O give thanks to the LORD. Call upon his name. [.linebr]#/# +
Make his deeds known among the people.

2 Sing to him. Sing psalms to him. [.linebr]#/# +
Talk of all his wondrous works.

3 Glory in his holy name. [.linebr]#/# +
Let the heart of those who seek the LORD rejoice.

4 Seek the LORD and his strength. [.linebr]#/# +
Seek his face evermore.

5 Remember his wonderful works which he has done, [.linebr]#/# +
his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,

6 O you offspring of Abraham his servant, [.linebr]#/# +
you children of Jacob his chosen.

7 He is the LORD our God. [.linebr]#/# +
His judgments are in all the earth.

8 He has remembered his covenant forever, [.linebr]#/# +
the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,

9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, [.linebr]#/# +
and his oath to Isaac,

10 And confirmed the same to Jacob for a law [.linebr]#/# +
and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,

11 Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, [.linebr]#/# +
the lot of your inheritance,"

12 When they were a few men in number, [.linebr]#/# +
even very few, and strangers in it.

13 When they went from one nation to another, [.linebr]#/# +
from one kingdom to another people,

14 He allowed no man to do them wrong. [.linebr]#/# +
He even reproved kings for their sakes,

15 Saying, "Do not touch my anointed [.linebr]#/# +
and do my prophets no harm."

16 Moreover, he called for a famine upon the land. [.linebr]#/# +
He broke the whole staff of bread.

17 He sent a man before them, [.linebr]#/# +
even Joseph, who was sold for a servant.

18 They hurt his feet with fetters, [.linebr]#/# +
and he was laid in iron.

19 Until the time that his word came to pass, [.linebr]#/# +
the word of the LORD tried him.

20 The king sent and released him, [.linebr]#/# +
even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.

21 He made him lord of his house [.linebr]#/# +
and ruler of all his substance,

22 To bind his princes at his pleasure [.linebr]#/# +
and teach his elders wisdom.

23 Israel also came into Egypt, [.linebr]#/# +
and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

24 And he increased his people greatly [.linebr]#/# +
and made them stronger than their enemies.

25 He turned their heart to hate his people, [.linebr]#/# +
to deal subtly with his servants.

26 He sent Moses his servant [.linebr]#/# +
and Aaron whom he had chosen.

27 They showed his signs among them [.linebr]#/# +
and wonders in the land of Ham.

28 He sent darkness and made it dark, [.linebr]#/# +
and they did not rebel against his word.

29 He turned their waters into blood [.linebr]#/# +
and slew their fish.

30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance [.linebr]#/# +
in the chambers of their kings.

31 He spoke, and there came swarms of flies [.linebr]#/# +
and lice in all their borders.

32 He gave them hail for rain [.linebr]#/# +
and flaming fire in their land.

33 He also smote their vines and their fig-trees [.linebr]#/# +
and broke the trees of their borders.

34 He spoke, and the swarming-locusts [.linebr]#/# +
and licking-locusts came—and that without number—

35 And ate up all the herbs in their land [.linebr]#/# +
and devoured the fruit of their ground.

36 He also smote all the first-born in their land, [.linebr]#/# +
the chief of all their strength.

37 He also brought them forth with silver and gold. [.linebr]#/# +
And there was not one feeble person among their tribes.

38 Egypt was glad when they departed, [.linebr]#/# +
for the fear of them fell upon them.

39 He spread a cloud for a covering [.linebr]#/# +
and fire to give light in the night.

40 The people asked, and he brought quails [.linebr]#/# +
and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out. [.linebr]#/# +
They ran in the dry places like a river.

42 For he remembered his holy promise [.linebr]#/# +
and Abraham his servant.

43 And he brought forth his people with joy [.linebr]#/# +
and his chosen with gladness.

44 He gave them the lands of the heathen, [.linebr]#/# +
and they inherited the labor of the people,

45 So that they might observe his statutes [.linebr]#/# +
and keep his laws. [.linebr]#/# +
Praise the LORD.

_The psalmist exhorts to praise God, 1-3. He prays for pardon of sin, as God pardoned the fathers, 4-6. The story of the people's rebellion and God's mercy, 7-46. He concludes with prayer and praise, 47, 48._

1 Praise the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good. [.linebr]#/# +
For his mercy endures forever.

2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? [.linebr]#/# +
Who can show forth all his praise?

3 Blessed are those who keep judgment [.linebr]#/# +
and he who does righteousness at all times.

4 Remember me, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
with the favor that you bear to your people. [.linebr]#/# +
O visit me with your salvation

5 So that I may see the good of your chosen, [.linebr]#/# +
so that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, [.linebr]#/# +
so that I may glory with your inheritance.

6 We have sinned with our fathers. [.linebr]#/# +
We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.

7 Our fathers did not understand your wonders in Egypt. [.linebr]#/# +
They did not remember the multitude of your mercies, [.linebr]#/# +
but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red Sea.

8 Nevertheless, he saved them for his name's sake [.linebr]#/# +
so that he might make his mighty power to be known.

9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

[[psa106-010]]10 And he saved them from the hand of him who hated them [.linebr]#/# +
and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

11 And the waters covered their enemies. [.linebr]#/# +
There was not one of them left.

12 Then they believed his words. [.linebr]#/# +
They sang his praise.

13 They soon forgot his works. [.linebr]#/# +
They did not wait for his counsel,

14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness [.linebr]#/# +
and tested God in the desert.

15 And he gave them their request, [.linebr]#/# +
but sent leanness into their soul.

16 In the camp they also envied Moses [.linebr]#/# +
and Aaron, the saint of the LORD.

17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan [.linebr]#/# +
and covered the company of Abiram.

18 And a fire was kindled in their company. [.linebr]#/# +
The flame burned up the wicked.

19 They made a calf in Horeb [.linebr]#/# +
and worshiped the molten image.

20 Thus they changed their glory [.linebr]#/# +
into the similitude of an ox that eats grass.

21 They forgot God their Savior [.linebr]#/# +
who had done great things in Egypt,

22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham [.linebr]#/# +
and awesome things by the Red Sea;

23 Therefore, he said that he would destroy them, [.linebr]#/# +
had Moses his chosen not stood before him in the breach [.linebr]#/# +
to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.

24 They even despised the pleasant land [.linebr]#/# +
and did not believe his word,

25 But murmured in their tents [.linebr]#/# +
and did not listen to the voice of the LORD;

26 Therefore, he lifted up his hand against them [.linebr]#/# +
to overthrow them in the wilderness,

27 To overthrow their offspring also among the nations, [.linebr]#/# +
and to scatter them in the lands.

28 They joined themselves also to Baal-peor [.linebr]#/# +
and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions, [.linebr]#/# +
and the plague broke in upon them.

30 Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment. [.linebr]#/# +
And so the plague was stayed.

31 And that was counted to him for righteousness [.linebr]#/# +
to all generations forever.

32 They also angered him at the waters of strife [.linebr]#/# +
so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes,

33 For they provoked his spirit [.linebr]#/# +
and he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.

34 They did not destroy the nations, [.linebr]#/# +
concerning whom the LORD commanded them,

35 But were mingled among the heathen [.linebr]#/# +
and learned their works.

36 And they served their idols, [.linebr]#/# +
which were a snare to them.

37 They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,

38 And shed innocent blood, [.linebr]#/# +
even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, [.linebr]#/# +
whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. [.linebr]#/# +
And the land was polluted with blood.

39 Thus they were defiled with their own works [.linebr]#/# +
and went astray with their own inventions.

40 Therefore, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against his people [.linebr]#/# +
because he abhorred his own inheritance.

41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen, [.linebr]#/# +
and those who hated them ruled over them.

42 Their enemies also oppressed them, [.linebr]#/# +
and they were brought into subjection under their hand.

43 Many times he delivered them, [.linebr]#/# +
but they provoked him with their counsel [.linebr]#/# +
and were brought low for their iniquity.

44 Nevertheless, he regarded their affliction [.linebr]#/# +
when he heard their cry.

45 And he remembered for them his covenant [.linebr]#/# +
and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.

46 He also made them to be pitied [.linebr]#/# +
by all those who carried them captive.

47 Save us, O LORD our God, [.linebr]#/# +
and gather us from among the heathen [.linebr]#/# +
so that we may give thanks to your holy name [.linebr]#/# +
and triumph in your praise.

48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel [.linebr]#/# +
from everlasting to everlasting. [.linebr]#/# +
And let all the people say, "Amen." [.linebr]#/# +
Praise the LORD.

whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy

3 And gathered out of the lands [.linebr]#/# +
from the east, from the west, [.linebr]#/# +
from the north, and from the south.

4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way. [.linebr]#/# +
They found no city to dwell in.

5 Hungry and thirsty, [.linebr]#/# +
their soul fainted in them.

6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, [.linebr]#/# +
and he delivered them out of their distresses.

7 And he led them forth by the right way [.linebr]#/# +
so that they might go to a city of habitation.

8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness [.linebr]#/# +

10 There are those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, [.linebr]#/# +
being bound in affliction and iron,

11 Because they rebelled against the words of God [.linebr]#/# +
and despised the counsel of the Most High.

12 Therefore, he brought down their heart with labor. [.linebr]#/# +
They fell down, and there was no one to help.

13 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, [.linebr]#/# +
and he saved them out of their distresses.

14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death [.linebr]#/# +
and broke their bonds apart.

15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness [.linebr]#/# +

16 For he has broken the gates of brass [.linebr]#/# +

17 Fools, because of their transgression [.linebr]#/# +

19 Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, [.linebr]#/# +

21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness [.linebr]#/# +
and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving [.linebr]#/# +
and declare his works with rejoicing.

23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, [.linebr]#/# +
who do business on great waters,

24 These see the works of the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and his wonders in the deep.

25 For he commands and raises the stormy wind, [.linebr]#/# +
which lifts up its waves.

26 They mount up to the heaven. [.linebr]#/# +
They go down again to the depths. [.linebr]#/# +
Their soul is melted because of trouble.

27 They reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man. [.linebr]#/# +
They are at their wit's end.

28 Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, [.linebr]#/# +
and he brings them out of their distresses.

29 He calms the storm to a gentle breeze [.linebr]#/# +
so that the waves of the sea are still.

30 Then they are glad because they are quiet. [.linebr]#/# +
Thus he brings them to their desired haven.

31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness [.linebr]#/# +
and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people [.linebr]#/# +
and praise him in the assembly of the elders.

33 He turns rivers into a wilderness, [.linebr]#/# +
the water-springs into dry ground,

34 And a fruitful land into barrenness [.linebr]#/# +
because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.

35 He turns the wilderness into a standing water [.linebr]#/# +
and dry ground into water-springs.

36 And there he makes the hungry to dwell [.linebr]#/# +
so that they may prepare a city for habitation.

37 They sow the fields and plant vineyards, [.linebr]#/# +
which yield fruits of increase.

38 He also blesses them so that they are multiplied greatly. [.linebr]#/# +
He does not allow their livestock to decrease.

39 Again, they are diminished and brought low [.linebr]#/# +
through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.

40 He pours contempt upon princes [.linebr]#/# +
and causes them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way.

41 Yet he sets the poor on high from affliction [.linebr]#/# +
and increases their families like a flock.

42 The righteous shall see it and rejoice, [.linebr]#/# +
and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

43 Whoever is wise and will observe these things, [.linebr]#/# +
even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the LORD.

14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
and do not let the sin of his mother be blotted out.

15 Let them be before the LORD continually [.linebr]#/# +
so that he may cut off their memory from the earth.

16 For he did not remember to show mercy, [.linebr]#/# +
but persecuted the poor and needy man [.linebr]#/# +
so that he might even slay the broken in heart.

17 As he loved cursing, so let it come to him. [.linebr]#/# +
As he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.

18 As he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, [.linebr]#/# +
so let it come into his body like water [.linebr]#/# +
and like oil into his bones.

19 Let it be to him as the garment which covers him [.linebr]#/# +
and for a girdle with which he is girded continually.

20 Let this be the reward of my adversaries from the LORD [.linebr]#/# +
and of those who speak evil against my soul.

21 But deal with me, O Yahweh the Lord, for your name's sake. [.linebr]#/# +
Because your mercy is good, deliver me.

22 For I am poor and needy, [.linebr]#/# +
and my heart is wounded within me.

23 I am gone like the shadow when it declines. [.linebr]#/# +
I am tossed up and down like the locust.

24 My knees are weak through fasting, [.linebr]#/# +
and my flesh fails of fatness.

25 I also became a reproach to them. [.linebr]#/# +
When they looked upon me, they shook their heads.

26 Help me, O LORD my God. [.linebr]#/# +
O save me according to your mercy,

27 So that they may know that this is your hand, [.linebr]#/# +
that you, LORD, have done it.

28 They may curse, but you bless. [.linebr]#/# +
When they arise, let them be ashamed, [.linebr]#/# +
but let your servant rejoice.

29 Let my adversaries be clothed with shame, [.linebr]#/# +
and let them cover themselves with their own shame [.linebr]#/# +
as with a mantle.

30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth. [.linebr]#/# +
I will even praise him among the multitude.

31 For he will stand at the right hand of the poor [.linebr]#/# +
to save him from those who condemn his soul.

1 Praise the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Praise the name of the LORD. [.linebr]#/# +
Praise him, O servants of the LORD.

2 You who stand in the house of the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
in the courts of the house of our God,

3 Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good. [.linebr]#/# +
Sing praises to his name, for it is pleasant.

4 For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, [.linebr]#/# +
Israel for his peculiar treasure.

5 For I know that the LORD is great [.linebr]#/# +
and that our Lord is above all gods.

6 Whatever the LORD pleased, he did [.linebr]#/# +
in heaven and in earth, [.linebr]#/# +
in the seas and all deep places.

7 He causes the vapors to ascend [.linebr]#/# +
from the ends of the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
He makes lightnings for the rain. [.linebr]#/# +
He brings the wind out of his treasuries.

8 He smote the first-born of Egypt, [.linebr]#/# +
both of man and beast.

9 He sent tokens and wonders [.linebr]#/# +
into the midst of you, O Egypt, [.linebr]#/# +
upon Pharaoh and upon all his servants.

10 He smote great nations [.linebr]#/# +
and slew mighty kings:

11 Sihon king of the Amorites, [.linebr]#/# +
Og king of Bashan, [.linebr]#/# +
and all the kingdoms of Canaan.

12 He gave their land for a heritage, [.linebr]#/# +
a heritage to Israel his people.

13 Your name, O LORD, endures forever, [.linebr]#/# +
and your memorial, O LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
throughout all generations.

14 For the LORD will judge his people [.linebr]#/# +
and have compassion on his servants.

15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, [.linebr]#/# +

16 They have mouths, but they do not speak. [.linebr]#/# +
They have eyes, but they do not see.

17 They have ears, but they do not hear, [.linebr]#/# +
neither is there any breath in their mouths.

18 Those who make them are like them, [.linebr]#/# +
and so is everyone who trusts in them.

19 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel. [.linebr]#/# +
Bless the LORD, O house of Aaron.

20 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi. [.linebr]#/# +

1 [_To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David._]

O LORD, you have searched me and known me.

2 You know my sitting down and my rising up. [.linebr]#/# +
You understand my thought afar off.

3 You compass my path and my lying down [.linebr]#/# +
and are acquainted with all my ways.

4 For there is not a word on my tongue, [.linebr]#/# +
but behold, O LORD, you know it altogether.

5 You have beset me behind and before [.linebr]#/# +
and laid your hand upon me.

6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. [.linebr]#/# +
It is high. I cannot attain to it.

7 Where shall I go from your Spirit? [.linebr]#/# +
Or where shall I flee from your presence?

8 If I ascend into heaven, you are there. [.linebr]#/# +
If I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there.

9 If I take the wings of the morning [.linebr]#/# +

10 Even there your hand shall lead me [.linebr]#/# +

even the night shall be light around me,"

12 Even the darkness does not hide from you, [.linebr]#/# +
but the night shines like the day. [.linebr]#/# +
The darkness and the light are both alike to you.

13 For you have possessed my inmost being. [.linebr]#/# +
You have covered me in my mother's womb.

14 I will praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. [.linebr]#/# +
Your works are wonderful, [.linebr]#/# +
and that my soul knows well.

15 My substance was not hid from you [.linebr]#/# +
when I was made in secret [.linebr]#/# +
and skillfully formed in the lowest parts of the earth.

16 Your eyes saw my substance, being without form. [.linebr]#/# +
And in your book they were all written, [.linebr]#/# +
even the days that were ordained for me, [.linebr]#/# +
when as yet there were none of them.

17 How precious your thoughts are to me, O God! [.linebr]#/# +
How great the sum of them is!

18 If I should count them, [.linebr]#/# +
they are more in number than the sand. [.linebr]#/# +
When I awake, I am still with you.

19 Surely you will slay the wicked, O God. [.linebr]#/# +
Depart from me therefore, you bloody men.

20 For they speak against you wickedly, [.linebr]#/# +
and your enemies take your name in vain.

21 Do I, O LORD, not hate those who hate you? [.linebr]#/# +
And am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?

22 I hate them with perfect hatred. [.linebr]#/# +
I count them my enemies.

23 Search me, O God, and know my heart. [.linebr]#/# +

_The prophet exhorts to praise God for his care of the church, 1-3; his power and wisdom, 4, 5; his mercy, 6; his providence, 7-11; to praise him for his blessings upon the kingdom, 12-14; for his power over the elements, 15-18; and for his ordinances in the church, 19, 20._

1 Praise the LORD, [.linebr]#/# +
for it is good to sing praises to our God. [.linebr]#/# +
For it is pleasant, and praise is fitting.

2 The LORD builds up Jerusalem. [.linebr]#/# +
He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.

3 He heals the broken in heart [.linebr]#/# +
and binds up their wounds.

4 He tells the number of the stars. [.linebr]#/# +
He calls them all by their names.

5 Our Lord is great and of great power. [.linebr]#/# +
His understanding is infinite.

6 The LORD lifts up the meek. [.linebr]#/# +
He casts the wicked down to the ground.

7 Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving. [.linebr]#/# +
Sing praise upon the harp to our God,

8 Who covers the heaven with clouds, [.linebr]#/# +
who prepares rain for the earth, [.linebr]#/# +
who makes grass to grow upon the mountains.

9 He gives to the beast his food, [.linebr]#/# +
and to the young ravens which cry.

10 He does not delight in the strength of the horse. [.linebr]#/# +
He does not take pleasure in the legs of a man.

11 The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him, [.linebr]#/# +
in those who hope in his mercy.

12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem. [.linebr]#/# +
Praise your God, O Zion.

13 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates. [.linebr]#/# +
He has blessed your children within you.

14 He makes peace in your borders [.linebr]#/# +
and fills you with the finest of the wheat.

15 He sends forth his commandment upon the earth. [.linebr]#/# +
His word runs very swiftly.

16 He gives snow like wool. [.linebr]#/# +
He scatters the hoar-frost like ashes.

17 He casts forth his ice like morsels. [.linebr]#/# +
Who can stand before his cold?

18 He sends out his word and melts them. [.linebr]#/# +
He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow.

19 He shows his word to Jacob, [.linebr]#/# +
his statutes and his judgments to Israel.

20 He has not dealt so with any nation. [.linebr]#/# +
And as for his judgments, they have not known them. [.linebr]#/# +
Praise the LORD.
