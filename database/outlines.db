jhn:21:0|Christ, appearing again to his disciples, is made known to them by the great multitude of fish caught in the net, 1-11. He dines with them, 12-14; earnestly commands Peter to feed his lambs and sheep, 15-17; foretells him of his death, 18-21; rebukes his curiosity concerning John, 22, 23. The conclusion, 24, 25.
act:1:0|Christ, preparing his apostles for the beholding of his ascension, gathers them together on mount Olivet, commands them to expect in Jerusalem the sending down of the Holy Spirit, promises after a few days to send him, and ascends into heaven in their sight, 1-9. After his ascension they are warned by two angels to depart and to set their minds upon his second coming, 10, 11. They accordingly return, and, giving themselves to prayer, choose Matthias to be apostle in place of Judas, 12-26.
act:2:0|The apostles, filled with the Holy Spirit and speaking various languages, are admired by some and derided by others, 1-13; whom Peter disproves, 14-36; he baptizes a great number who were converted, 37-40; who afterward devoutly and charitably fellowship together; the apostles working many miracles, and God daily increasing his church, 41-47.
act:3:0|Peter, preaching to the people who came to see a lame man restored to his feet, 1-11, professes the cure not to have been wrought by his or John's own power or holiness, but by God and his son Jesus, and through faith in his name, 12. In addition, he reproves them for crucifying Jesus, 13-16; which they did through ignorance, and thereby fulfilled God's determinate counsel and the Scriptures, 17, 18. He exhorts them by repentance and faith to seek remission of their sins and salvation in the same Jesus, 19-26.
act:4:0|The rulers of the Jews, offended by Peter's sermon, 1, 2, imprison him and John, 3, 4. After examining Peter for boldly avouching the lame man to be healed by the name of Jesus, and that by the same Jesus only we must be eternally saved, 5-12, they command him and John to preach no more in that name, adding also threatening, 13-22; whereupon the church flees to prayer, 23-30. And God, by moving the place where they were assembled, testifies that he heard their prayer; confirming the church with the gift of the Holy Spirit and with mutual love and charity, 31-37.
act:5:0|Ananias and Sapphira his wife fell down dead for their hypocrisy at Peter's rebuke, 1-11. The rest of the apostles wrought many miracles, 12, 13; to the increase of the faith, 14-16. The apostles are again imprisoned, 17, 18; but delivered by an angel bidding them preach openly to all, 19, 20. But after their teaching accordingly in the temple, 21-28, and before the council, 29-32, they are in danger to be killed; but through the advice of Gamaliel, a great counselor among the Jews, they are kept alive and are only beaten, for which they glorify God, 33-41. They did not cease from daily preaching, 42.
act:6:0|The Hellenistic Jews are discontent that their widows were neglected in the daily ministration, and to address this, the apostles meet, 1, 2, recommend, 3, 4, and with the church's consent, ordain seven chosen men to the office of deaconship, 5, 6. The word of God prevails, 7. Stephen, full of faith and the Holy Spirit, disproving those with whom he disputed, is brought before the council and falsely accused of blasphemy against the law and the temple, 8-15.
act:7:0|Stephen, permitted to answer to the accusation of blasphemy, 1, shows that Abraham worshiped God rightly, and how God chose the fathers, 2-19, before Moses was born and before the tabernacle and temple were built, 20-36; that Moses himself witnessed of Christ, 37-43; and that all outward ceremonies were ordained, according to the heavenly pattern, to last only for a time, 44-50; reproving their rebellion and murdering of Christ, the Just One, whom the prophets foretold should come into the world, 51-53. Upon hearing that, they stone him to death, while he commends his soul to Jesus and humbly prays for them, 54-60.
act:8:0|The disciples were dispersed because of a great persecution at Jerusalem, Saul's persecution of the church, and a church is planted by Philip in Samaria, 1-8. Simon the sorcerer is baptized, along with many others, 9-13. Peter and John are sent there, who prayed for them and laid their hands on them, after which they received the Holy Spirit, 14-17. Simon offers money for the same power, is sharply reproved by Peter for his wickedness and hypocrisy, and admonished to repent, 18-24. The apostles return to Jerusalem, having preached the word, 25. Philip is sent by an angel to convert and baptize an Ethiopian eunuch 26-40.
act:9:0|Saul, going toward Damascus, is stricken down to the earth and led blind to Damascus, 1-9; is called to the apostleship, 10-17; and is baptized by Ananias, 18, 19. He preaches Christ boldly, 20-22. The Jews lay wait to kill him, 23-28; so do the Grecians, but he escapes both, 29, 30. The church having rest, Peter heals Eneas of paralysis, 31-35; and restores Tabitha to life, 36-43.
act:10:0|Cornelius, a devout man, being commanded by an angel, sends for Peter, 1-10, who by a vision is taught not to despise the Gentiles, 11-16; and is commanded by the Spirit to go with the messenger to Caesarea, 17-24. Cornelius discloses the occasion of his sending for him, 25-33. As he preaches Christ to Cornelius and his company, 34-43, the Holy Spirit falls on them and they are baptized, 44-48.
act:11:0|Peter, being accused of going to the Gentiles, 1-4, makes his defense, 5-17; which is accepted, 18. The gospel being spread into Phenice, Cyprus, and Antioch, Barnabas is sent to confirm them, 19-25. The disciples there are first called Christians, 26. They send relief to the brothers in Judea in time of famine, 27-30.
act:12:0|King Herod persecutes the Christians, kills James, and imprisons Peter, whom an angel delivers upon the prayers of the church, 1-19.

act:13:0|Paul and Barnabas are chosen to go to the Gentiles, 1-5. Of Sergius Paulus and Elymas the sorcerer, 6-12. Paul preaches at Antioch that Jesus is Christ, 13-41. The Gentiles believe, 42, 43; but the Jews gainsay and blaspheme, whereupon Paul and Barnabas turn to the Gentiles, of whom many believe, 44-49. The Jews raise a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, who go to Iconium, 50-52.
act:14:0|Paul and Barnabas are persecuted from Iconium, 1-7. At Lystra Paul heals a cripple, whereupon they are reputed as gods, 8-18. Paul is stoned, 19, 20. They pass through various churches, confirming the disciples in faith and patience, 21-25. Returning to Antioch, they report what God had done with them, 26-28.
act:15:0|Great dissensions arise concerning circumcision, 1-4. The apostles consult about it, 5-21, and send their determination by letters to the churches, 22-35. Paul and Barnabas, thinking to visit the brothers together, disagree and travel different ways, 36-41.
act:16:0|Paul, having circumcised Timothy, 1-6, and being called by the Spirit from one country to another, 7-13, converts Lydia, 14, 15, and casts out a spirit of divination, 16-18; for which cause he and Silas are whipped and imprisoned, 19-24. The prison doors are opened. 25-30. The jailer is converted, 31-34, and they are delivered, 35-40.

Being persecuted by Jews from Thessalonica, 13-15, he comes to Athens, disputing with the Jews and preaching the living God, to them unknown, 16-31; whereby, though some mock, many are converted to Christ, 32-34.
act:18:0|Paul labors with his hands and preaches at Corinth to the Gentiles, 1-8. The Lord encourages him in a vision, 9-11. He is accused before Gallio the deputy, but is dismissed, 12-17. Afterward, passing from city to city, he strengthens the disciples, 18-23. Apollos, being more perfectly instructed by Aquila and Priscilla, preaches Christ with great efficacy, 24-28.
act:19:0|Some disciples receive the Holy Spirit after they are baptized in Jesus’ name and Paul lays his hands on them, 1-7. The Jews blaspheme his doctrine, which is confirmed by miracles, 8-12. The Jewish exorcists, 13-15, are beaten by the devil, 16-18. Conjuring books are burnt, 19, 20. Demetrius, for love of gain, raises an uproar against Paul, 21-34; which is appeased by the town-clerk, 35-41.
act:20:0|Paul goes to Macedonia, and from there to Troas, 1-6. He celebrates the Lord's supper and preaches, 7, 8. Eutychus, having fallen down dead, is raised to life, 9-12.

act:21:0|Paul arrives at the house of Philip, whose daughters prophesy, 1-9. Agabus foretells what should happen to him at Jerusalem; he will not be dissuaded from going there, 10-16. He comes to Jerusalem, 17-26; where he is apprehended and in great danger, but by the chief captain is rescued, 27-36; and requests and is permitted to speak to the people, 37-40.
act:22:0|Paul declares at large how he was converted to the faith, 1-16, and called to his apostleship, 17-21. At the very mentioning of the Gentiles the people cry out against him, 22, 23. He would have been scourged, 24; but claiming the privilege of a Roman, he escapes, 25-30.
act:23:0|As Paul pleads his cause, 1, Ananias commands them to smite him, 2-6. Dissension among his accusers, 7-10. God encourages him, 11-13. The Jews' laying wait for Paul, 14-19, is declared to the chief captain, 20-26. He sends him to Felix the governor, 27-35.
act:24:0|Paul, being accused by Tertullus the orator, 1-9, answers for his life and doctrine, 10-23. He preaches Christ to the governor and his wife, 24, 25. The governor hopes for a bribe, but in vain, 26. At last, going out of his office, he leaves Paul in prison, 27.
act:25:0|The Jews accuse Paul before Festus, 1-7. He answers for himself, 8-10, and appeals to Caesar, 11-13. Afterward, Festus opens his matter to King Agrippa, 14-22; and he is brought forth, 23, 24. Festus clears him of having done anything worthy of death, 25-27.
act:26:0|Paul, in the presence of Agrippa, declares his life from his childhood, 1-11; and how miraculously he was converted and called to his apostleship, 12-23. Festus charges him with being mad, to which he answers modestly, 24-27. Agrippa is almost persuaded to be a Christian, 28-30. The whole company pronounces him innocent, 31, 32.
act:27:0|Paul, sailing toward Rome, 1-9, foretells about the danger of the voyage, 10, but is not believed, 11-13. They are tossed to and fro by the tempest, 14-40; and suffer shipwreck, 41-43; yet all come safe to land 44.
act:28:0|Paul, after his shipwreck, is kindly entertained by the barbarians, 1-2. The viper on his hand does not hurt him, 3-6. He heals many diseases on the island, 7-10. They depart toward Rome, 11-16. He declares to the Jews the cause of his coming, 17-23. After his preaching, some were persuaded and some did not believe, 24-29. He preaches there two years, 30, 31.
rom:1:0|Paul commends his calling to the Romans, 1-8; and his desire to come to them, 9-15. What his gospel is, 16, 17. God is angry with sin, 18-20. What were the sins of the Gentiles, 21-32.
rom:2:0|No excuse for sin, 1-5. No escape from judgment, 6-13. Gentiles cannot, 14-16; nor Jews, 17-29.
rom:3:0|The Jews' prerogative, 1, 2; which they have not lost, 3-8; however the law convinces them also of sin, 9-19; therefore no flesh is justified by the law, 20-27; but all, without difference, are justified by faith only, 28-30; and yet the law is not abolished, 31.
rom:4:0|Abraham's faith was imputed to him for righteousness, 1-9; before he was circumcised, 10-12. By faith only he and his offspring received the promise, 13-15. Abraham is the father of all who believe, 16-23. Our faith also shall be imputed to us for righteousness, 24, 25.
rom:5:0|Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, 1; and joy in our hope, 2-7; that since we were reconciled by his blood when we were enemies, 8, 9; we shall much more be saved, being reconciled, 10, 11. As sin and death came by Adam, 12-16; so much more righteousness and life by Jesus Christ, 17-19. Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, 20, 21.
rom:6:0|We may not live in sin, 1; for we are dead to it, 2; as appears by our baptism, 3-11. Do not let sin reign anymore, 12-17; because we have yielded ourselves to the service of righteousness, 18-22; and for that, death is the wages of sin, 23.
rom:7:0|No law has power over a man longer than he lives, 1-3. But we are dead to the law, 4-6. Yet the law is not sin, 7-11; but holy, just, and good, 12-15; as Paul acknowledges, who is grieved because he cannot keep it, 16-25.
rom:8:0|Those who are in Christ are free from condemnation, 1-4. What harm comes of the flesh, 5-12; and what good of the Spirit, 13-18. The glorious deliverance all things long for, 19-28, was beforehand decreed from God, 29-37. Nothing can sever us from his love, 38, 39.
rom:9:0|Paul is sorry for the Jews, 1-5. The promise to Abraham did not include all his descendants, 6-13. God's sovereignty, 14-24. The calling of the Gentiles and rejecting of the Jews foretold, 25-31. The cause of the Jews' stumbling, 32, 33.
rom:10:0|The Scripture shows the difference between the righteousness of the law and that of faith, 1-10; and that all who believe, both Jew and Gentile, shall not be confounded, 11-17; and that the Gentiles shall receive the word and believe, 18. Israel was not ignorant of these things, 19-21.
rom:11:0|God has not cast off all Israel, 1-6. Some were elected, though the rest were hardened, 7-15. There is hope of their conversion, 16, 17. The Gentiles may not boast over them, 18-25; for there is a promise of their salvation, 26-32. God's judgments are unsearchable, 33-36.
rom:12:0|God's mercies must move us to please God, 1, 2. No man must think too well of himself, 3-5; but everyone attend on that calling wherein he is placed, 6-8. Love and many other duties are required of us, 9-18. Revenge is especially forbidden, 19-21.
rom:13:0|Subjection and many other duties we owe to the magistrates, 1-7. Love is the fulfilling of the law, 8-10. Gluttony and drunkenness, and the works of darkness, are out of season in the time of the Gospel, 11-14.
rom:14:0|Men may not despise nor condemn one another for things indifferent, 1-12; but take heed that they give no offense in them, 13, 14; which the apostle proves unlawful by many reasons, 15-23.
rom:15:0|The strong must bear with the weak, 1. We may not please ourselves, 2; for Christ did not do so, 3-6; but receive one another, as Christ did us all, 7; both Jews and Gentiles, 8-14; Paul excuses his writing, 15-27; and promises to see them, 28, 29; and requests their prayers, 30-33.
rom:16:0|Paul desires the brothers to greet many, 1-16; and advises them to take heed of those who cause dissension and offenses, 17-20; and after various salutations ends with praise and thanks to God, 21-27.
1co:1:0|After his salutation and thanksgiving, 1-9, Paul exhorts them to unity, 10, 11, and reproves their dissensions, 12-17. God destroys the wisdom of the wise, 18-20, by the foolishness of preaching, 21-25; and does not call the wise, mighty, and noble, 26, 27, but the foolish, weak, and men of no account, 28-31.
1co:2:0|Paul declares that his preaching, though it is not with excellency of speech, or of human wisdom, yet consists in the power of God, 1-5; and so far excels the wisdom of this world and human sense that the natural man cannot understand it, 6-16.
1co:3:0|Milk is fit for children, 1, 2. Strife and division, arguments of a fleshly mind, 3-6. He who plants and he who waters are nothing, 7, 8. The ministers are God's fellow workers, 9, 10. Christ is the only foundation, 11-15. Men are the temples of God, which must be kept holy, 16-18. The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, 19-23.
1co:4:0|Judgments, human and Divine, respecting ministers, 1-5. Contrast between the inflated self sufficiency of the Corinthians and the earthly humiliation of the apostles, 6-13. The practical steps which Paul intends to take with reference to these party divisions, 14-21.
1co:5:0|The incestuous person, 1-5, is cause rather of shame to them than of rejoicing, 6. The old leaven is to be purged out, 7-9. Heinous offenders are to be shamed and avoided, 10-13.
1co:6:0|The Corinthians must not vex their brothers in going to law with them, 1-5; especially under unbelievers, 6-8. The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God, 9-14. Our bodies are the members of Christ and temples of the Holy Spirit; therefore, they must not be defiled, 15-20.
1co:7:0|Paul discusses marriage, 1-3; showing it to be a remedy against fornication, 4-9, and that the bond thereof ought not lightly to be dissolved, 10-19. Every man must be content with his vocation, 20-24. Virginity therefore to be embraced, 25-34; and for what respects we may either marry or abstain from marrying, 35-40.
1co:8:0|To abstain from foods offered to idols, 1-7. We must not abuse our Christian liberty to the offense of our brothers, 8-10; but must bridle our knowledge with charity, 11-13.
1co:9:0|Paul shows his liberty, 1-6; and that the minister ought to live by the Gospel, 7-14; yet that he has of his own accord abstained, 15-17, to be either chargeable to them, 18-21, or offensive to any, in matters indifferent, 22, 23. Our life is compared to a race, 24-27.
1co:10:0|The sacraments of the Jews are types of ours, 1-6; and their punishments, 7-10, examples for us, 11-13. We must flee from idolatry, 14-20. We must not make the Lord's table the table of devils, 21-23; and in things indifferent we must have regard for our brothers, 24-33.
1co:11:0|Paul reproves them, because in holy assemblies, 1-3, their men prayed with their heads covered, 4, 5, and women with their heads uncovered, 6-16; and because generally their meetings were not for the better, but for the worse, 17-20; as, namely, in profaning with their own feasts the Lord's supper, 21-24. Lastly, he calls them to the first institution thereof, 25-34.
1co:12:0|Spiritual gifts, 1-3, are diverse, 4-6, yet given to every man for profit, 7. And to that end are diversely bestowed, 8-11; so that by similar proportion, as the members of a natural body tend all to the mutual decency, 12-21, service, 22-25, and support of the same body, 26; we should also do for one another, to make up the body of Christ, 27-31.
1co:13:0|All gifts, 1, 2, however excellent, are worth nothing without charity, 3. The praises thereof, 4-12, and preferment before hope and faith, 13.
1co:14:0|Prophecy is commended, 1, and preferred before speaking with languages, 2-5, by a comparison drawn from musical instruments, 6-11. Both must be referred to edification, 12-21, as to their true and proper end, 22-25. The gifts of both languages and prophecy are directed in their use, 26-33. Women are forbidden to speak in the church, 34-40.
1co:15:0|By Christ's resurrection, 1-11, Paul proves the necessity of our resurrection against all those who deny the resurrection of the body, 12-20. The fruit, 21-34, and the manner thereof, 35-50; and of the changing of those who shall be found alive at the last day, 51-58.
1co:16:0|Paul exhorts them to relieve the lack of the brothers at Jerusalem, 1-9. Commends Timothy, 10-12; and after friendly admonitions, 13-15, concludes his epistle with various salutations, 16-24.
2co:1:0|Paul salutes the Corinthians, 1, 2; he encourages them against troubles by the comforts and deliverances which God had given him, as in all his afflictions, 3-7, so particularly in his late danger in Asia, 8-11. And calling both his own conscience and theirs to witness of his sincere manner of preaching the immutable truth of the gospel, 12-14, he excuses his not coming to them as proceeding not of lightness, but of his kindness toward them, 15-24.
2co:2:0|Having shown the reason why he did not come to them, 1-5, Paul requires them to forgive and to comfort that excommunicated person, 6-9, even as he also upon his true repentance had forgiven him, 10, 11; declaring in addition why he departed from Troas to Macedonia, 12, 13, and the happy success which God gave to his preaching in all places, 14-17.
2co:3:0|Lest their false teachers should charge him with vain glory, Paul shows the faith and graces of the Corinthians to be a sufficient commendation of his ministry, 1-5. Whereupon entering a comparison between the ministers of the law and of the gospel, 6-11, he proves that his ministry is so far the more excellent, as the gospel of life and liberty is more glorious than the law of condemnation, 12-18.
2co:4:0|Paul declares how he has used all sincerity and faithful diligence in preaching the gospel, 1-6, and how the troubles and persecutions which he daily endured for the same led to the praise of God's power, 7-11, to the benefit of the church, 12-15, and to the apostle's own eternal glory, 16-18.
2co:5:0|That in his assured hope of immortal glory, 1-8, and in expectation of it, and of the general judgment, Paul labors to keep a good conscience, 9-11; not that he may herein boast of himself, 12, 13, but as one who, having received life from Christ, endeavors to live as a new creature to Christ only, 14-17, and by his ministry of reconciliation, to reconcile others also in Christ to God, 18-21.
2co:6:0|Paul has approved himself a faithful minister of Christ by his exhortations, 1, 2, and by integrity of life, 3, and by patiently enduring all kinds of affliction and disgrace for the gospel, 4-10. Of which he speaks the more boldly among them because his heart is open to them, 11-12, and he expects a similar affection from them again, 13; exhorting them to flee the society and pollutions of idolaters, as being themselves temples of the living God, 14-18.
2co:7:0|Paul proceeds in exhorting them to purity of life, 1; and to bear him similar affection as he does to them, 2. Whereof lest he might seem to doubt, he declares what comfort he took in his afflictions by the report which Titus gave of their godly sorrow, which his former epistle had wrought in them, 3-12; and of their loving-kindness and obedience toward Titus, answerable to his former boastings of them, 13-16.
2co:8:0|Paul stirs them up to a liberal contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem by the example of the Macedonians, 1-6; by commendation of their former forwardness, 7, 8; by the example of Christ, 9-13; and by the spiritual profit that shall come back upon themselves thereby, 14, 15; commending to them the integrity and willingness of Titus, along with those other brothers, who upon his request, exhortation, and commendation, purposely came to them for this business, 16-24.
2co:9:0|Paul yields the reason why, though he knew their forwardness, he sent Titus and his brothers beforehand, 1-5. And he proceeds in stirring them up to a bountiful alms, as being but a kind of sowing of seed, 6-9, which shall return a great increase to them, 10-12, and occasion a great sacrifice of thanksgivings to God, 13-15.
2co:10:0|Against the false apostles, who disgraced the weakness of his person and bodily presence, Paul shows the spiritual might and authority with which he was armed against all adverse powers, 1-6; assuring them that at his coming he will be found as mighty in word as he is now in writing, being absent, 7-11; and refuses to justify himself or to act by such rules as the false teachers did, but according to the better rules he had fixed for himself, 12-18.
2co:11:0|Out of his jealousy over the Corinthians, who seemed to make more account of the false apostles than of him, Paul enters into a forced commendation of himself, 1-4, of his equality with the chief apostles, 5, 6, of his preaching the gospel to them freely, and without any charge to them, 7-12; showing that he was not inferior to those deceitful workers in any legal prerogative, 13-22; and in the service of Christ, and in all kinds of sufferings for his ministry, far superior, 23-33.
2co:12:0|For commending of his apostleship, though he might glory about his wonderful revelations, 1-8, yet Paul rather chooses to glory in his infirmities, 9, 10; blaming them for forcing him to this vain boasting, 11-13. He promises to come to them again; but yet altogether in the affection of a father, 14-19; although he fears he shall to his grief find many offenders and public disorders there, 20, 21.
2co:13:0|Paul threatens severity and the power of his apostleship against obstinate sinners, 1-4. And, advising them to a trial of their faith, 5, 6, and to a reformation of their sins before his coming, 7-10, he concludes his epistle with a general exhortation and a prayer, 11-14.
gal:1:0|Paul wonders that they have so soon left him and the gospel, 1-7; and accurses those who preach any other gospel than he did, 8-10. He learned the gospel not from men, but from God, 11-13; and shows what he was before his calling, 14-16; and what he did immediately after it, 17-24.
gal:2:0|Paul relates when he went up again to Jerusalem and for what purpose, 1, 2; and that Titus was not circumcised, 3-10; and that he resisted Peter and told him the reason, 11-13; why he and others, being Jews, do believe in Christ to be justified by faith and not by works, 14-19; and that they do not live in sin who are so justified, 20, 21.
gal:3:0|Paul asks what moved them to leave the faith and hang upon the law, 1-5. Those who believe are justified, 6-8, and blessed with Abraham, 9. And this he shows by many reasons, 10-29.
gal:4:0|We were under the law until Christ came, as the heir is under the guardian until he is of age, 1-4. But Christ freed us from the law, 5, 6; therefore we are servants no longer to it, 7-13. Paul remembers their good will to him and his to them, 14-21; and shows that we are the sons of Abraham by the free-woman, 22-31.
gal:5:0|Paul desires them to stand in their liberty, 1, 2, and not to observe circumcision, 3-12; but rather love, which is the sum of the law, 13-18. He reckons up the works of the flesh, 19-21, and the fruits of the Spirit, 22-24, and exhorts to walk in the Spirit, 25, 26.
gal:6:0|Paul moves them to deal mildly with a brother who has slipped, 1, and to bear one another's burden, 2-5; to be liberal to their teachers, 6-8, and not weary of well-doing, 9-11. He shows what they intend who preach circumcision, 12, 13. He glories in nothing, except in the cross of Christ, 14-18.
eph:1:0|After the salutation, 1, 2, and thanksgiving for the Ephesians, 3, Paul discusses our election, 4, 5, and adoption by grace, 6-10; which is the true and proper fountain of man's salvation, 11, 12. And because the height of this mystery cannot easily be attained to, 13-15, he prays that they may come to the full knowledge and possession thereof in Christ, 16-23.
eph:2:0|By comparing what we were by nature with what we are by grace, 1-9, Paul declares that we are made for good works and, being brought near by Christ, should not live as Gentiles and foreigners as in time past, but as citizens with the saints and the family of God, 10-22.
eph:3:0|The hidden mystery that the Gentiles should be saved was made known to Paul by revelation, 1-7; and to him that grace was given so that he should preach it, 8-12. He desires that they not faint for his tribulation, 13; and prays that they may perceive the great love of Christ toward them, 14-21.
eph:4:0|Paul exhorts to unity, 1-6; and declares that God therefore gives various gifts to men, 7-10; so that his church might be edified, 11-15, and grow up in Christ, 16, 17. He calls them from the impurity of the Gentiles, 18-23; to put on the new man, 24; to cast off lying, 25-28; and corrupt communication, 29-32.
eph:5:0|After general exhortations to love, 1, 2; to flee fornication, 3; and all uncleanness, 4-6; not to converse with the wicked, 7-14; to walk carefully, 15-17; and to be filled with the Spirit, 18-21; Paul descends to the particular duties, how wives ought to obey their husbands, 22-24; and husbands ought to love their wives, 25-31, even as Christ does his church, 32, 33.
eph:6:0|The duty of children toward their parents, 1-4; of servants toward their masters, 5-9. Our life is a warfare, not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual enemies, 10-12. The complete armor of a Christian, 13-17; and how it ought to be used, 18-20. Tychicus is commended, 21-24.
phl:1:0|Paul testifies his thankfulness to God and his love toward the Philippians for the fruits of their faith and fellowship in his sufferings, 1-8; daily praying to him for their increase in grace, 9-11; he shows what good the faith of Christ had received by his troubles at Rome, 12-20; and how ready he is to glorify Christ either by his life or death, 21-26; exhorting them to unity, 27; and to fortitude in persecution, 28-30.
phl:2:0|Paul exhorts them to unity and to all humbleness of mind by the example of Christ's humility and exaltation, 1-11; to a careful proceeding in the way of salvation, that they be as lights to the wicked world, 12-15, and comforts to him their apostle, who is now ready to be offered up to God, 16-18. He hopes to send Timothy to them, and Epaphroditus also, 19-30.
phl:3:0|Paul warns them to beware of the false teachers of the circumcision, 1-3; showing that he has greater cause than they do to trust in the righteousness of the law, 4-6; but he renounces it all to gain Christ and his righteousness, 7-11; therein acknowledging his own imperfection, 12-14. He exhorts them to be thus minded, 15, 16; and to imitate him, 17, and to decline the ways of carnal Christians, 18-21.
phl:4:0|From particular admonitions, 1-3, Paul proceeds to general exhortations, 4-9, showing how he rejoiced at their liberality toward him lying in prison, not so much for the supply of his own lack as for the grace of God in them, 10-18. And so he concludes with prayer and salutations, 19-23.
col:1:0|After salutation, Paul thanks God for their faith, 1-6; confirms the doctrine of Epaphras, 7, 8; prays further for their increase in grace, 9-13; describes the true Christ, 14-20; encourages them to receive Jesus Christ, and commends his own ministry, 21-29.
col:2:0|Paul still exhorts them to be constant in Christ, 1-7; to beware of philosophy and vain traditions, 8-17; worshiping of angels, 18, 19; and legal ceremonies, which are ended in Christ, 20-23.
col:3:0|Paul shows where we should seek Christ, 1-4. He exhorts to mortification, 5-9; to put off the old man and to put on Christ, 10, 11; exhorting to charity, humility, and other various duties, 12-25.
col:4:0|Paul exhorts them to be fervent in prayer, 1-4; to walk wisely toward those who have not yet come to the true knowledge of Christ, 5-9. He salutes them and wishes them all prosperity, 10-18.
1th:1:0|The Thessalonians are given to understand both how mindful of them Paul was at all times in thanksgiving and prayer, 1-4; and also how well he was persuaded of the truth and sincerity of their faith and conversion to God, 5-10.
1th:2:0|In what manner the gospel was brought and preached to the Thessalonians and in what sort also they received it, 1-17. A reason is rendered both why Paul was so long absent from them and also why he was so desirous to see them, 18-20.
1th:3:0|Paul testifies his great love to the Thessalonians, partly by sending Timothy to them to strengthen and comfort them; partly by rejoicing in their well doing, 1-9; and partly by praying for them and desiring a safe coming to them, 10-13.
1th:4:0|Paul exhorts them to go forward in all manner of godliness, 1-5; to live in holiness and justly, 6-8; to love one another, 9, 10; and quietly to follow their own business, 11, 12; and last of all, to sorrow moderately for the dead, 13-16. And to this last exhortation is annexed a brief description of the resurrection and second coming of Christ to judgment, 17, 18.
1th:5:0|Paul proceeds in the former description of Christ's coming to judgment, 1-15; and gives various precepts, 16-22; and then concludes the epistle, 23-28.
2th:1:0|Paul certifies them of the good opinion which he had of their faith, love, and patience, 1-10; and in addition uses various reasons for the comforting of them in persecution, of which the chief is taken from the righteous judgment of God, 11, 12.
2th:2:0|Paul urges them to continue steadfast in the truth received, 1, 2; shows that there shall be a departure from the faith, 3-8, and a revealing of Antichrist before the day of the Lord comes, 9-14; and thereupon repeats his former exhortation and prays for them, 15-17.
2th:3:0|Paul craves their prayers for himself, 1, 2; testifies what confidence he has in them, 3, 4; makes request to God on their behalf, 5; gives them various precepts, especially to shun idleness and ill company, 6-15; and then concludes with prayer and salutation, 16-18.
1ti:1:0|Timothy is put in mind of the charge which was given to him by Paul at his going to Macedonia, 1-4. Of the right use and end of the law, 5-10. Of Paul's calling to be an apostle, 11-19; and Hymeneus and Alexander, 20.

1ti:4:0|Paul foretells that in the latter times there shall be a departure from the faith, 1-5. And to the end that Timothy might not fail in doing his duty, he furnishes him with various precepts belonging thereto, 6-16.

From what Timothy is to flee and what he is to follow, 11-16; and of what he is to admonish the rich, 17-19. He is to keep the purity of true doctrine and to avoid profane babblings, 20, 21.
2ti:1:0|Paul's love for Timothy, and the unfeigned faith which was in Timothy himself, his mother, and grandmother, 1-5. He is exhorted to stir up the gift of God which was in him, 6, 7; to be steadfast and patient in persecution, 8-12; and to persist in the form and truth of that doctrine which he had learned from him, 13, 14. Phygellus and Hermogenes and such as those are noted, and Onesiphorus is highly commended, 15-18.
2ti:2:0|Timothy is exhorted again to constancy and perseverance, and to do the duty of a faithful servant of the Lord in dividing the word rightly and avoiding profane and vain babblings, 1-16. Of Hymeneus and Philetus, 17, 18. The foundation of the Lord is sure, 19-21.

jms:1:0|We are to rejoice under the cross, 1-4; to ask patience of God, 5-12; and in our trials not to impute our weakness or sins to him, 13-18, but rather to listen to the word, meditate on it, and be doers of it, 19-25. Otherwise, men may only seem, but never be, truly religious, 26, 27.
jms:2:0|It is not agreeable to Christian profession to regard the rich and despise the poor brothers, 1-12; rather we are to be loving and merciful, 13; and not to boast of faith where no deeds are, 14-16; which is but a dead faith, 17, 18; the faith of devils, 19, 20; not of Abraham, 21-24; nor Rahab, 25, 26.
jms:3:0|We are not rashly or arrogantly to reprove others, 1-4; but rather to bridle the tongue, a little member, but a powerful instrument of much good and great harm, 5-12. Those who are truly wise are mild and peaceable without envying and strife, 13-18.
jms:4:0|We are to strive against covetousness, 1-3; intemperance, 4; pride, 5-10; and slander and rash judgment of others, 11, 12.

1pe:1:0|Peter blesses God for his manifold spiritual graces, 1-9; showing that salvation in Christ is an object of deepest interest to the prophets and to angels, 10-12; and exhorts them accordingly to a godly way of life, since they are now born anew by the word of God, 13-25.

2pe:2:0|Peter foretells them about false teachers, showing the impiety and punishment both of them and their followers, 1-6; from which the godly shall be delivered, as Lot was out of Sodom, 7-9; and more fully describes the manners of those profane and blasphemous seducers, whereby they may be the better known and avoided, 10-22.
2pe:3:0|Peter assures them of the certainty of Christ's coming to judgment against those scorners who dispute against it, 1-7.

1jn:1:0|John describes the person of Christ, in whom we have eternal life by fellowship with God, 1-4; to which we must add holiness of life to testify the truth of our fellowship and profession of faith and also to assure us of the forgiveness of our sins by Christ's death, 5-10.
1jn:2:0|John comforts them against the sins of infirmity, 1, 2. To rightly know God is to keep his commandments, 3-8; to love our brothers, 9-14; and to not love the world, 15-17.

2jn:1:0|John exhorts a certain honorable matron and her children to persevere in Christian love and belief, 1-7, lest they lose the reward of their former profession, 8, 9; and to have nothing to do with those seducers who do not bring the true doctrine of Christ Jesus, 10-13.

jde:1:0|Jude exhorts them to be constant in the profession of the faith, 1-3.
